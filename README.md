### Repository for the Dataset Paper: Fostering Digital Inclusion for Low-Resource Nigerian Languages

This repository contains various folders and files related to data collection, processing, and benchmarking for Igbo and Nigerian Pidgin languages. Below is a detailed description of the contents:

---

#### 1. **web_scraping** Folder

- Contains all code used to scrape sentences in Igbo and Nigerian Pidgin from five sources:
  - BBC Igbo
  - Igbo Government Broadcasts
  - TED Talks in Igbo
  - BBC Nigerian Pidgin
  - Nigerian Pidgin Online Dictionary
- Includes all webpage link data files that were successfully scraped.

---

#### 2. **web_data_processing** Folder

- Contains all code used for preprocessing raw data.
- Includes all monolingual data files after scraping.

---

#### 3. **web_GPT_3.5**, **web_GPT_4**, and **web_GPT_4o** Folders

- Contain:
  - Code for data annotation using GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o models.
  - Code for post-processing annotated data.
  - All parallel data files annotated by GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o models.

---

#### 4. **AMTurk_Assign** Folder

- Contains:
  - Code used to randomly select sentences based on the sentence ratio for each source, which were then provided to Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers.
  - Files containing sentences in Igbo and Nigerian Pidgin that were assigned to AMT workers for annotation.

---

#### 5. **Benchmark_Dataset** Folder

- Contains folders with benchmark datasets:
  - **FLORES200**, **JW300**, and **MAFAND-MT**: Three publicly available benchmark datasets.
  - **AmazonMTurk**: A self-created, high-quality dataset translated by multiple Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. These datasets are used to evaluate three large language models (LLMs): 
    - NLLB (Meta)
    - ByT5 (Google)
    - DeltaLM (Microsoft)
  - **AmazonTrans**: Contains sentences generated by GPT models to calculate BLEU scores and compare them with the performance of fine-tuned models.
  
- Contains code for:
  - Calculating BLEU scores.
  - Summarizing dataset information.
  - Filtering sentences annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.
