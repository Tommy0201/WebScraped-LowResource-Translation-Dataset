After he finished speaking, I came to ask myself if it was how Jehovah saw me that I saw myself.
At first, I didn't want to believe that what my heart is telling me now is true.
My heart still tells me that Jehovah will not forsake me.
Obi has not yet given me the strength that Jehovah can see me in love, but I began to think about the dust of Jesus’ salvation.
My eyes were opened immediately. I have come to understand that Jehovah has been with me, having shown me many ways that He loves me while I have been patient.
It seems that I am offering the sacrifice that Jehovah has established through His Son for us.

The magazine is a house of protection that gives praise to Jehovah God, the ruler of heaven and earth.
The good news is that the Kingdom of God, which is the government in heaven, will soon put an end to all wickedness and make the world become a paradise.
He tells people to have faith in Jesus Christ, who died so that we may have eternal life, and who is also the King reigning now in the Kingdom of God.
The Jehovah's Witnesses have been publishing this magazine since 1879. It does not participate in politics.
Everything it says is from the Bible.
The baby and his father are in perfect condition.
The person who told Bebe that thing to make her heart feel better is one of the women in her family who is doing well. However, what she told Bebe broke her heart.
What Bebe is asking herself is, “Is my father's death not a good thing?”
After many years had passed, Bebe wrote this incident in a book. What she wrote shows that she still feels the pain of her father's death.
One thing Bebe came to realize is that it is not easy for a person to stop feeling the weight of the death of someone they loved, especially if they were in a good relationship with that person.
The Bible refers to death as "the last enemy."
The person we love has died; it disrupts our lives greatly, especially if that person died suddenly.
No one among us is immune to bad luck or misfortune.
This is why it sometimes becomes difficult for us to know what to do when someone has died.
You may be thinking, saying: 'How many years will it take a person to stop mourning someone they loved?
How can I comfort people who are heartbroken?
Will those who have died live again?
Have you already recovered from your little illness?
Let us consider what Abraham did when his wife died.
The Bible says that "he began to weep, Sarah weeping for her children."
When the Bible said that Abraham "began" to cry for his wife, it indicates that he took some time before he was able to accept the death of his wife.
It has pained him deeply for "many days." His family members have also not had the strength to comfort him.
After many years had passed, the death of Joseph still grieved him. — Genesis 37:34, 35; 42:36; 45:28.
A woman named Gail, who is sixty years old, said: "My husband Robert died in an accident that happened on the night of the ninth of July 2008."
Six years after his death, I am still heartbroken.
"I don't think he/she will leave me heartbroken."
A man named Etienne, who is forty-eight years old, said: “Although it is more than eighteen years since my good wife died, I still feel her presence and miss her greatly.”
"I saw something beautiful, I remember it, and I wonder how his heart would feel if he saw what I saw."
Indeed, there is no one that finds it easy to endure a person's death.
The way people experience grief varies, and it is also not good to criticize someone for how they grieve.
We should not blame ourselves if it becomes difficult for us to endure the death of our loved ones.
In the article titled "Remember Their Faith," which is in this Watchtower, it was stated that about three years after Sarah's mother died, she was still overwhelmed by her loss. — Genesis 24:67.
It may be that you have heard here about how a person who has died should not be mourned or made to feel that death is painful for them.
There are also people who say that the person should stop crying and do everything that will show that what happened hurts them.
But, the Bible says something that experts today have discovered also helps.
In some places, it is said that a man should not wear a skirt.
But, is it not wrong for someone to be ashamed of themselves when they are alone in front of others?
The doctors said it is not serious if a person dies without crying.
Sometimes, it helps the person to find themselves, while also doing other things they are supposed to do.
But that person who is always crying may cause themselves trouble.
The Bible does not say that it is bad for a man to marry a woman.
When Lazarus, his friend, died, he wept in front of the crowd even though he could have raised him. — John 11:33-35
There are people who get really angry when someone dies, especially if the person died unexpectedly.
Many things can make a person who is heartbroken angry. It could be that the person they respected spoke words that hurt them.
A man from South Africa named Mike spoke about what happened when his father died.
When he was being buried, the Anglican priest said that God wants good people and that He calls them quickly.
This thing he said made me very angry because our father is very important to us.
Some people regret taking their own lives, especially if the person died unexpectedly.
The Bible tells us, saying: “A true friend loves at all times, and is a brother born for adversity.” — Proverbs 17:17.
The best friend of a person who died can express how their heart feels is the One who created us, which is Jehovah.
Pray, tell him how you feel because ‘what concerns you touches him in the heart.’
He promised that he would use “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding” to calm your heart if you tell him what troubles you.
The other thing that will comfort you is the Bible.
Remembering what those scriptures said will help you, especially when you are alone at night, and sleep does not come to you. — Isaiah 57:15
There is a man who is about forty years old that we will call Jack. Cancer killed his wife not long ago.
He said: "I prayed, and Jehovah made the storm stop bothering me."
I often wake up at night, get up, read some parts of the Bible, think about what I read, and also tell Jehovah about the troubles in my heart.
Obi has brought me to the land, sleep has also abandoned me again.
A mother of a girl named Vanessa is struggling with a terminal illness.
Vanessa has not yet found out that prayer has tremendous power.
He said: “It pains my heart terribly because of what was done to me, I also called on God, and I cried bitterly...”
"Jehovah is also giving me strength to endure."
Some people learned that giving advice to those who have lost a loved one can help them as they help others or engage in activities that will benefit their community.
They are doing it, their heart will be at ease, and they will also take care of themselves.
Many Christians have not yet discovered that helping others comforts them. — 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.
What distresses you also distresses God. — Psalm 55:22; 1 Peter 5:7.
God does for His servants what they ask of Him. — Psalm 86:5; 1 Thessalonians 5:17.
He will call to God to awaken the dead. — Job 14: 13 - 15
God promised to raise the dead. — Isaiah 26:19; John 5:28, 29.
Have you ever found yourself not knowing what to do or what to say to please someone who has lost a loved one?
There are some people like that; they will never do anything to make that person happy.
But, see some things you can do to help that person.
What is most often said by many people who have lost a loved one is to go to their home and say, "I'm sorry."
In many places in the world, hitting that person or slapping them will make them know that what happened to them upset us.
That person wants to speak, listen to them carefully.
The most important thing you can do for the family regarding what happened is to do things for them that they cannot do, such as cooking, taking care of their children, or helping with burial arrangements if they would like.
What you did for them means more to them than the ordinary words you told them.
As time goes by, you may talk about the person who passed away, perhaps recounting some good qualities that person had or things they did that made you happy.
For example, a woman named Pam died six years ago.
His name is Ian. Pam said, "Sometimes, people tell me about the good things I've done that I don't even know about. It also makes me happy."
Researchers say that when a person dies recently, people come to console their family members.
But, after a short time, everyone will start to do things that are theirs, and there will be no one to remember to come and help those who helped them.
Therefore, try to communicate often with your friend who has passed away.
This type of thing is liked by many people because it allows them to express how the problem affects them emotionally, and they also find themselves.
Something happened to Kaori. She is a Japanese girl.
One of them is Ritsuko. Ritsuko loves Kaori very much.
She also spoke to Kaori. Kaori said, "To be honest, my heart isn't well because of how it is affecting my mother..."
But because of how my mother shows me that she loves me, I and she have become very close.
I and him/her go for evangelism and learning every week.
He/she is inviting me to join him/her for tea or to cook food together.
He writes me letters and also sends me cards often.
"My mother's good character has helped me a lot."
Twelve years have passed since Mama Kaori died. Also, Kaori and her husband are always sending good news.
Kaori said, "Mama Ritsuko keeps showing me that she loves me."
"Whenever I go to our house, I go to visit her. I enjoy talking to her, and it makes me happy."
His name is Sozos. He does not use it for playing. He is also an elder known for his wisdom in the Christian community.
They often invite their male friends and late wives to come to their house, where they chat and also share meals.
But the disease that affected Sozo's brain killed him when he was fifty-three years old.
When they arrived, they began to join the Jehovah's Witnesses congregation there in learning.
Poli said, "Our relatives here in this community do not know what is causing our problems with him."
But they came close to us, telling us words that reach our hearts, and also helping us with some things.
The elders who oversee our association do not use Daniel for music.
One of them is always calling him to go wherever he and his friends want to go.
"He is also calling him to play football."
Poli and her son are having a good time today.
One thing that is clear is that there are many things we can do to help people in need and encourage them.
What the Bible says about the future will also speak to our hearts.
Some people mark the date of that person's death on their calendar so they can remember to comfort those who mourn on any day in the year or when that date arrives.
In the second chapter of this House of Security, Gail said that she did not think Rob's death would leave her heart.
But, he/she hopes to see him/her again in the new world God promised.
"The ones I am currently comforting are those who do not know that they can see their deceased loved ones again."
In the time that is not far off, when God will make this world a paradise, He will raise both Job and many other dead people.
The Bible says in the book of Acts 24:15 that "there will be a resurrection of the dead."
Jesus told us, saying: "Let this thing not trouble you, for the hour is coming when all those in the graves will hear his voice and come out."
He will never regain his "youthful strength," his body is even newer than it was when he was a child, until the end of time.
It is also the same thing that will be done for all those who will show that they have faith that God will fulfill the promise He made to raise the dead.
If there has been someone who has died for you, doing the things we talked about in this book may not completely stop your sadness.
But, reflecting on the promises that God made in the Bible can help you have hope that things will get better, and also enable you to act on other things you need to do. — 1 Thessalonians 4:13
You will see what the Bible says will help you and strengthen your heart.
"[God] will wipe out all tears from their eyes; death will be no more." — Revelation 21:3, 4.
This topic discusses how God will fulfill the promise He made and the benefits it will bring to you.
ISIOKWU ỤLỌ NCHE A | WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING WITH JIZO'S YAM AND THE DEAD?.
Jesus of Nazareth was killed during the harvest season at the age of 33.
He was falsely accused of being involved in an underground government fight. He was hit on the head with a stick and also tied up on a tree.
You will read this story in the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
They are in the Greek New Testament of the Christians, which many people refer to as the New Testament.
Let us find out if what is written in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John is mere fiction.
The books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are not like fairy tales.
If you read them, you will see that the writers were careful to write about what they did and how they did it.
For example, they named existing towns, many of those towns still exist to this day.
They spoke about those who were alive in this world, those whose historical accounts have not yet been discovered, and those they mentioned were alive in that time. — Luke 3:1, 2, 23.
What Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote about how he was led to be crucified in a manner consistent with how the Romans of that time executed a person sentenced to death.
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John shared things they indicated as having happened in truth.
They do not engage in certain things that followers of Jesus do.
All of this shows that they spoke the truth and that everything they wrote about Jesus is true.
Many people believe that Jesus lived and then died, but some do not believe that he rose from the dead.
His disciples did not believe when they were first told that he had risen from the dead.
But they and others who followed Jesus eventually believed after they saw Jesus repeatedly after he rose from the dead.
He appeared to more than five hundred people at once. — 1 Corinthians 15:6
Those who follow Jesus announce to everyone, even those who killed Jesus, that he has been raised from the dead, despite the possibility of being imprisoned or even killed.
Will their hearts not be troubled if they are not sure that Jesus was raised from the dead?
What made many people become Christians, both in the past and today, is because they firmly believe that Jesus was raised from the dead.
If you read what Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote about the death and resurrection of Jesus, you will know that they are true.
If you read them carefully, it will surprise you that these things happened.
They will keep an eye on you to see if you understand why they did it.
He was born when the apostles of Jesus were still alive. He said: "It was when Tiberius was ruling that one of our governors, named Pontius Pilate, brought Christ to trial for death, from whose name the name [Christians] is derived."
Others who spoke about Jesus were Switonius (who lived during the time of Jesus' disciples); Josephus, a Jewish historian (who also lived during the time of Jesus' disciples); and Pliny the Younger, who was the governor of Bithynia (a short time after Jesus' disciples had passed away).
Another thing is that many of Jesus' enemies at that time would not have stayed to write anything that would convince people that the things being said about Jesus are true.
One of Jesus' apostles named Peter spoke about the resurrection of Jesus, saying: "God raised this one on the third day and made him appear, not to all the people, but to the witnesses God had chosen beforehand, to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead."
He said that when the Jews, who were the enemies of Jesus, heard that Jesus had been raised from the dead, they tried to make people stop spreading the news. — Matthew 28: 11 - 15
Does it mean that Jesus did not want people to know that he was raised from the dead?
No. Peter said: "He has also given us the command to proclaim the gospel to the people and to testify that this is the One whom God has appointed to be the judge of the living and the dead."
Good Christians have spoken about it, and they continue to do so. — Acts 10:42
"Sin came into the world through one man [that is, Adam], and death came through sin." — Romans 5:12.
If someone asks you if you want to live forever, what will you answer?
Many people will say that they will want, but they did not think it would be possible.
They will also say that everyone who is alive will eventually die one day.
But if you are asked if you want to die, what will you answer?
Many people will say no.
The Bible says it shows that God created us to live and to hunger.
"It has been said that 'He has put eternity in [our] hearts.' - Ecclesiastes 3:11."
But, people do not live forever today.
Has God not done something to save us?
We know what the Bible says about these questions, we will be glad, and we will also understand why Jesus suffered and died.
Genesis chapters one to three tell us that God told Adam and Eve what they should do to live forever.
There it was explained how they turned away from God, which caused them to miss eternal life.
The way this story is told is so easy to understand that some people say it is a fairy tale.
But, if you read the book of Genesis, you will see that it reported events like how Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John reported events.
What did Adam's sin cause?
The Bible says: “Sin entered the world through one man [that is, Adam], and death came through sin, and in this way death spread to all people because all sinned.”
That is why there is no eternal life anymore.
Where we are his children, we also share in his sins.
But, is there no way that God has done to save us?
Indeed, God has made provisions for humanity to live eternally, unlike Adam, who did not because of his disobedience.
The Bible says in Romans 6:23 that "the wages of sin is death."
It means that whoever sins will die.
We are not free from the sun because we are committing sins.
But it is not us who caused the reason for our death; rather, we inherited sin from Adam.
Therefore, God showed that He loves us by sending His Son, Jesus, to come and pay the price for our sins with His life.
The death of Jesus gave us hope that we will live forever and be happy.
Since Adam was a perfect man before he sinned, in order for us to be sinners and die, the one who will have the power to save us from sin and death must be a perfect man who will not sin until he dies.
The Bible explains it this way: “Just as many were made sinners through the disobedience of one man, so also will many be made righteous through the obedience of one man.”
He came from heaven to become a complete man on earth, * also died for us.
That is why we will be able to be righteous in the sight of God and have hope for eternal life.
But, why did Jesus have to die before he could save us?
Can the Almighty Creator of all things not say that Adam's children will live forever without someone dying for them?
It is said that if God has not judged rightly in this matter, the heart will not believe that He will judge rightly in other matters.
For example, what will he rely on to decide whether Adam's son is fit for eternal life?
He made a promise, can we trust that he will fulfill it?
Since God has done the right thing to save us, we are confident that He will always do the right thing.
God who sacrificed Jesus with His life, may He grant us the hope of everlasting life when the world becomes Paradise.
Here is what Jesus said in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
What Jesus said means that his death shows that God always makes a just judgment. However, more importantly, it shows that God loves humanity very much.
What are the reasons why Jesus suffered greatly before He died as narrated by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?
The way Jesus endured all the suffering he faced, submitting to God until his death, shows that the devil does not lie when he says that no one can submit to God while suffering.
One might think that what Satan said was true when he made Adam, who was perfect, to sin.
But Jesus, being perfect like Adam, submitted to God despite the suffering he endured.
It indicates that Adam himself also humbled himself before God and said that he wanted.
God blessed His son for the way he served Him.
He gave him life that has no end in heaven.
He said: “To obtain everlasting life, it is important for them to know you well, the only true God, and the one you sent, Jesus Christ.” — John 17:3.

God said from heaven to give life to His Son in the womb of Mary; Mary is pregnant. The Holy Spirit of God also ensured that Jesus would not carry sin in the hands of Mary. — Luke 1:31, 35.
When Jesus and his disciples were gathered on the night before the day he was to be killed, he began the things that would be used to commemorate his death.
He told them, saying: "Do this so that you may remember me."
Jehovah's Witnesses around the world practice what Jesus said. They commemorate Jesus' death every year.
This year, the death of Jesus will be commemorated on Wednesday, the twenty-third night of March, when the sun has set.
No one will be given money.
Please, ask Jehovah's Witnesses around where you live when and where it will be done.

You are saying that Ekwensu is...
What evil is in a person's heart?
The devil said to Jesus, "Try him with temptation."
Ekwensu was once a holy angel, but 'he does not stand firm in truth.'
He became a liar and an enemy of God.

The devil makes people oblivious to the fact that he is a real spirit. — 2 Corinthians 4:4

But God will help you resist the devil. — James 4:7

Once a sibling runs for their life, the elders should do what is stated in the book "Those Who Prepare to Think Like Jehovah," in chapter eight, paragraph thirty.

How can parents teach their children to regard the worship of Jehovah as important?
What should parents not expect from their children?
Your children should ensure that they ‘seek the kingdom’ of God first, they will learn to trust in Jehovah and He will meet their needs every day.

What benefits will your children gain if they learn your language?
Parents, if it is like that for your children, can you try to help them learn that local language?
If your child is beginning to understand a language you do not speak, do you not think you should learn that language?

Read 1 Corinthians 14:9, 11.
What Jehovah answered us in that prayer is not good for us.
But when we saw that our children were not benefiting from the education that was taught in our language, we decided to switch to a system that used the language of the community they live in for learning.
We are with them studying the teachings and the good news closely.
We also invite our friends to come eat with us and hang out.
All these things help our children to know their siblings, and to also know that Jehovah is their God, their Father, and their Friend.
"We consider these things more important than learning our language."
Samuel said, “My wife and I are going to learn in our language so that our faith may grow stronger.”

"Our three children serve Jehovah all the time."
One sister named Kristina said, "I know some words in the language my parents spoke, but the language used in education is very difficult for me."
When I was twelve years old, I went to a gathering where we spoke our language to learn in school.
This is my first time attending a meeting, and it makes me realize that what I am hearing is the truth.
Another thing is that I started using our language to learn in the school where we pray.
I am telling Jehovah how my heart feels.
The youths, do you think it will benefit you to attend a gathering where you learn in the language of where you live?
One sister, who works at Betel, named Nadia said: “When my siblings and I were growing up, we wanted to go through the meetings conducted in the languages of the places where we lived.”
Nadia said, "We are happy now that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and to make us stay in an environment where we learn using their language."
"It has made our lives much better, and it has also allowed us to help others know about Jehovah."
How can parents receive help in teaching their children the truth of the Bible?
Read Proverbs 1:8; 31:10, 27, 28.
But parents who do not understand the languages of the places where they live can ask someone else to help them so they can reach their children in heart.
Both the children and their parents benefit when they participate in their community gatherings (This will be explained in paragraphs 18 and 19).
What should parents be doing?

Show that you take the Bible seriously (It will be explained in paragraph 14).
On the night before the day Jesus was killed, he told his disciples, saying: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also should love one another."
"Everyone will know from this that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." — John 13:34, 35.

When I started it, it was difficult for me, and my heart sank.
He is singing, I see the people I work with in one place, they are laughing at me, asking me why I think eating ice cream is better than working in a computer repair shop where there is a lot of stress.
I prayed to Jehovah to help me deal with that problem and find time to serve Him, that is what I decided.
I will prepare the type of ice cream my customers want, including an old recipe in the ice cream.
At that time, I took the ice cream out, it finished that day.
The truth is that the money I earned exceeded what I was making when I was repairing computers.
I feel happy because I no longer worry about how I used to behave when I was fixing computers.
The most important thing is that I am now in a good relationship with Jehovah." — Read Matthew 5:3, 6.

When I was eighteen years old, I started to travel.

I told myself that he/she does not know how to write the thing he/she wrote.
