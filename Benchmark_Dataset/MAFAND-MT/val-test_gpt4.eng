When will Nigeria be out this month?
People are asking about Nigeria's 2018 budget document and why it hasn't been released yet.
Buhari is a farmer.
Buhari presented the 2018 budget to the lawmakers in November of 2017.
When the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, gave the Nigerian parliament the document detailing how the 2018 budget (as described by the British) would be distributed on the third day of November of the preceding year, people believed it would be released before the month of January 2018.
The current month now is May, it's the 5th month of 2018, but they didn't forget it's budget.
The experts who spoke on the economy noted how it has turned out today in that particular Nigeria, where the place it started deteriorated.
The news this morning: The senate made a law.
Obiano has made an Igala person a commissioner.
The senate has elected a new chief financial officer.
The reason for this offense is that he doesn't know when the police will interfere in his bribery and label him a criminal as it is against the law of the land.
The merchants said that the reason they could not release 'Budget 2018' is because the government's inconsistent policies have not given them a clear idea of how they are expected to divide their resources and assets, without considering the documents that the merchants have as evidence of how the disparate sector was supposed to generate money in 2018.
But the chamber saw the need for regulation, - which the Ministry of National Planning, as it is called in English - said all business people needed to have to regularize the budget therein the document they submitted.
Ben Akabueze, the head of the department overseeing the budget, said that everything the financial institutions needed was included in the financial act that Muhammadu Buhari gave the institutions in November of the previous year.
However, he has assured that the businessmen are calling different heads of department to come and reduce their prices, which he knows and does.
The thing he/she brought out.
The economists discussing the country's economy say that Nigeria will not have a good economy unless it becomes debt-free.
On social media platforms like Twitter, people are discussing what's happening.
The person with the handle @AdeBanqie on Twitter suggested that Nigerians should speak up and foreigners should not interfere in the leadership of one expressing their opinion.
The way that the government prepared the 'budget' is what BudgIT examined and this year's edition is the most extensive since it started publishing things about the budget in Nigeria.
OduObodumu is asking if there is another town that has documentation dating back to the beginning of this year.
@Purrples says that he is calling the head of the major manufacturers to come and lend his voice for the paper and the mess.
Another person involved in this conversation is @ApanpaOlasumbo, who is wondering why Nigerians are silent about this happening.
Regarding what they are doing, the lawyers say they will submit it on the 16th of this month, but this is not the first time they've said this, which makes us wonder, 'if a farmer kills a lion will he be afraid of a cat today?'.

Unity is what makes the Igbo and other communities respected, famous, or honored.
In this news, it talks about various types of markings.
Igbuichi translates to "Death trap" in English.
Many people died because of this war.
It will strike you as peculiar, but this photograph depicts the type of tattooing that people used to do in Igbo land long ago.
Igbuichi is at the crossroads.
One is the destiny of the Nri people for tomorrow, another is that of the Agbaja people.
Cooking and eating corn is currently prevalent in Anambra state, just like the rampant consumption of kola nut in Enugu state.
In the document, Journal of International African Institute, it was reported that the Igbo people do not practice facial scarification due to the belief it originates from where one has been killed.
The things you don't want to do in Igbo culture.
Aguleri and Igboukwu are not the origin of the Igbo people.
Things you need to know before you marry an Igbo woman.
It is for the sake of honour, whether pride or prestige, that you insist on standing out among others.
They are calling those who perform traditional rites or the elders.
Only the strong will survive the battle.
As the tradition says, only those who have taken the mark (tattoo) will escape death.
At that time, they had a belief that those who die of illness would live forever in the land of the spirits.
People who have tribal marks do not work like others, they don't carry anything on their heads.
It is a crime to deny them speech or to give them a book.
Death varies in different parts of Igbo land.
It is very important for the moon and the sun to be in their exact positions as they will continue to shine.
The moon is setting, the sun is overtaking it, the third will be the eclipse.
Reincarnating spirit.
Many Igbo people believe in the existence of reincarnation.
The reason they keep killing them is because their children think they are evil spirits.
As the tradition dictates, they heavily scar themselves so that the spirit of the Ogbanje would not recognize them if it returns.
Another is suffering from headache because of flies.
The Igbo people believe that it will take unity and peace for every ear to receive blessing and also to alleviate suffering amongst them.

Some died when they were being branded, many others defecated out of fear.
If they continue to torment that person, it's possible he might lose his mind.

Buhari sacked the board of directors of the budget airline in 2018.
On Tuesday, the big House of Representatives and the small one passed the 2018 Budget, where they proposed that government spending for the year would increase from 8.612 trillion naira to 9.120 trillion naira, representing a 500 billion naira increment.
That settlement amounting to N9,120,334,988,225 increased by N530,421,368,624 due to accrued interests according to law.
A total of N2,203,835,365,699 was expended for the repayment of a debt of N190,000,000,000 for bond redemption.

SARS: The things people are saying about their suffering.
The thing that happened is that America is not giving visas in Abuja currently.
The authorities in Ghana are making laws for how the Igbo traders will be trading in their country.
He said that the problem began when the Ghanaian government threatened Nigerians and other foreigners, insisting they should have something the English call 'equity' worth hundreds of dollars.
The person who suggested this idea is the minister in charge of commerce.
Obiora said that refusal to work is not a new thing, because the government has been repeating it in power, it's not easy nowadays just like it wasn't easy back then.
The market people are traveling abroad to get their goods.
Without mentioning when the market will start, Obiora said it is a Nigerian and Ghanaian government agreement that made them postpone it.
Make sure they know another way to get there.
The worshippers of Ekwensu are persecuting Nigeria.
Research those who lack 'equity' that will start tomorrow.
One person said that the person who would teach him this is Nwafor Akajiofor, who trades in the market called Ahịa Magazine.
Akajiofor said that the 'resident permit and equity' is a policy the Ghanaian government uses to limit the influx of Nigerians into Ghana.
He said that the document granting permission to live in Ghana is not a 'resident permit' and is not easy to obtain.
The resident permit costs 200,000, but obtaining it is not easy.
Obiora and himself say that the law that governs the seawaters is that Ghana establishes that people of other countries cannot fish in their market.
Those with fraudulent documents will not be allowed to trade in the market, they will only have to trade by the roadside, as the law stipulates.
Just as he said, if the Ghanaians flout this law, many generations in that country will suffer because they won't understand its implications.

The thing that scared these defense lawyers called Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers is the news that a Nigerian woman wants to use the fleeing from Female Genital Mutilation as her grounds for asylum.
The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) of Canada, which handles asylum cases, says it is a woman who has not provided sufficient documentation to support her claim for asylum from areas in Nigeria such as Ibadan or Port Harcourt.
The members of the IRB review committee stated that the review they will use to monitor other reviews regarding those fleeing Nigeria due to life-threatening start will be thorough.

Mohamed Morsi: his death in an Egyptian court of law was unexpected.
Mohamed Morsi was a fighter who served as the president of Egypt before he collapsed and died in a courthouse in Cairo.
Mohammed Morsi in 2012.
The soldiers overthrew Morsi in power in 2013.
The news reaching us today states that Mohammed Morsi, former leader of Egypt, has died in a Cairo courtroom at the capital city where he went for trial as some of his administrative workers testified.
One person speaking in the courthouse said: 'He gives the lawyer instructions before he proceeds.
If he rushes to the hospital, it's because he's sick.
Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi became the chairman of the African Union.
Morsi is the first person to rule who spoke his mind.
He remained in prison for a year before he was released in 2013 after the war ended in that country.
Morsi has been in jail since he was convicted for death in rioting that was meant to remove him from power.
The Egyptian government has forcefully suppressed supporters of Morsi and the group known as the 'Muslim Brotherhood', who are at the heart of their power.
This trial sentencing Morsi to death before he died is a conspiracy attributed to his involvement in a prison break said to have been carried out by Hamas in Palestine's suppression in Egypt.
Who is Morsi?
Morsi was born in the town of El-Adwah in the 'Nile Delta' region of Sharqiya in 1951.
He studied Law at Cairo University before going to America to get his master's degree.
The Muslim Brotherhood elected him as president in 2012 to serve as who they wanted him to be.
As he won, he promised that he would lead all the Egyptians.
Many who did not agree with him said that he broke his vow within one year before he left for Egypt.
People began to notice his hair loss on a day he held a meeting on June 30, 2013.
On the night of July 3, the soldiers overthrew the Egyptian government and announced that they have a new government.
Morsi said that it's not possible in this case.

But the Nigerian government's involvement in that matter has resulted in Nigerian children stopping schooling and trading in that country.

Ekweremmadu expressed great concern about the increasing level of violence happening in Nigeria.
The president of the Nigerian senate, Ike Ekweremadu said that the strength of the senate lies in unity, which is required in order to adequately address the high rate of influx of refugees in Nigeria at all times.
Ekweremadu argued that the oppression Nigerians face from the hands of the Fulanis leading herds is because the law makers have failed to enforce laws and grant them justice in one way or another.
Remember, one day ago, how a horrible accident claimed over fifteen lives in Logo and Guma Local Government Areas of Benue State, now another report says that over nineteen people have been killed in a clash in Taraba State.
Ekweremadu, in his speech at a human rights and law conference today, said that Nigeria will walk the path of peace and reconciliation, before he concluded his enlightening speech.
He said: 'The lawmakers are not representing the interests of all Nigerians.'
Our strength is failing in this second struggle for the hill's summit. What we desire is peace and reconciliation before it leads to a nationwide catastrophe.

The woman is eating yam and bean cake.
Many people are involved in labor, some in the fish market.
When Muhammadu Buhari is seeking leadership, one thing he profusely expresses is the promise that he will provide jobs for people.
The statement Buhari made on the drastic reduction in inflation rate in 2015 is what is on his lips today, it seems like his office is seeing the recent report from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) that indicated a rise from three to fifteen percent among the unemployed since 2016.
NBS said this in a document called 'Labour Force Statistics Vol. 2: Employment by Sector Report,'..
They submitted the document in Abuja before leaving.
What does this message mean?
BBC Igbo spoke to Cheta Nwanze, who works at SB Morgen, regarding how their office operates and what its services are. Cheta explained to us the nature of their work and how it was established, but he mentioned that the major event that led to the creation of the office happened two years ago in Nigeria.
My wife was at work when Nigeria and MTN had a problem which led to her being transferred to another work station.
That MTN issue has affected a lot of their workers as they are being retrenched with MTN refusing to give them a contract.
Many people used to work at Proctor and Gamble, but they were laid off when the company downsized its workforce.
'The pandemic affected many people,' as Cheta Nwanze said.
Some children (not those who have gone overseas) are not listed in the document because their mother and father are unemployed.
BBC Igbo interviewed Nwanze about what the Nigerian government is saying concerning job creation.
He said that the NBS report indicates that the output of palm kernel oil is not as high as he expected.
This is suggesting that the salary did not come despite the job involving handling oil, is it that fewer people are needed for the work or is it a reduction?.
When adversity strikes, you will see what truly matters.
BBC Igbo has asked those criticising the Nigerian government to express their opinions on the NBS report but no one amongst them has responded.
However, the Buhari government introduced N-POWER, School Feeding Programme and other things they called 'Social Empowerment Programmes', they said it would help people in Nigeria.

The kola nut is the one that is white; it is called kola because it looks good to the eyes.
The Ikenga kolanut has three parts, constantly red.
The Hausa's kola nut is what is called 'gworo', it has two lobes and is usually white.
The meal is delicious.

They use kola nut to welcome visitors.

The English people call it alligator pepper.
The white man's town called bitter kola "Aki ilu".
Water.

It is a law that the eldest becomes the elder who breaks the kola, where everyone else treats him as a child to carry and nurture him.
A man does not refuse kola nut in his in-laws' house, he shouldn't decline it where his friends are present, except they've not given him the authority to chew it.
It is indeed a custom that women do not climb kola nut trees in Igbo land.
Kola nut and women.
In the Igbo land, a woman does not climb a kola nut tree, she does not harvest kola nut from its tree.
A woman does not despise kola nut.
A woman does not climb a palm tree but a woman sells palm wine.
Women are not allowed to put their hands on the food pot if it happens that men are still eating there.
Some are going ahead to give a woman kolanut that she may not have the restriction of putting her hand in the soup pot she used in preparing the kolanut.

Give food to the 10 poor people the rich man is ignoring.
Some food seemed initially like what the poor would have, but it's what the rich demanded because of the discussions on health.
In Nigeria, after about three or four years, various dishes are seen as power foods.
Many of these foods are either produced by people in their farms or bought from the market because not many desire them.
But today, these meals are things that the rich delight in because they cause numerous diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer and obesity are diseases these are often referred to as 'diseases of the rich'.
The World Health Organization reported in 2008 that, out of 169 countries, 11.2 percent of Nigerians have high blood pressure and 2.7 percent have diabetes.
The disease these ones have caused many people to have difficulties in finding what to eat, a situation first experienced in the past and now they are experiencing an intense hunger that poverty-stricken children are unable to bear.
Read 10 in that list of food.
The refrigerator is cold.
They see a refrigerator as a luxury for the poor.
For over thirteen years now, the sight of fish being used to cook meals in the homes of the poor, orphans or during economically difficult times, where no one has money, places where goat meat or chicken meat is a luxury, has been common.
A man living in Lagos named Kingsley Udofa opened this discussion by saying: 'There was a time in our land Nigeria when refrigerators were for the rich.'
At that time, they used to call different types of fish refrigerator name, which were nicknamed 'Dead fish' in Igbo; 'Ókù Ékò' in Yoruba which means 'Lagos Corpse'; 'Àkpa asuko nse' in Ibibio which translates to, 'it has died but I was born seeing it.'
People are struggling to fish and eat to survive.
Currently, the music hasn't started.
The refrigerator is not cheap and this is why many people, including the wealthy ones, usually negotiate for a lower price in the market.

The lady with the metric tons of nine hundred containers and nine hundred and sixteen.
Language.
The yam has a big mouth.
Whether it's corn or coco yam or leafy vegetables, food is a big deal, a meal those who don't have their own corn dread because they have no money to buy corn.
But now, the food is like yam that has pepper in its hand and is hot due to the much salt and oil in it.
The town has been ravaged by malnutrition, with many people suffering from diseases like diabetes, hypertensive disorders and those who can't afford the high cost of such foods, which is a basic necessity like the price of buying food in the market.
Book.
The leather bag that the Yorubas call 'kpomo' is what the poor use to satisfy themselves when they cannot afford to buy beef or chicken.
Just like the parable, the rich man prepared a feast, where he served an elaborate meal such as Edikang Ikong soup or invited them to eat and drink wine.
In 2014, when the government announced that the Minister in charge of elders was Akinwumi Adesina, he stated that they want to feed ten thousand people that comprised of adults and insisted that the government should stop farming in the bush.
As the scientists stated, red meat does not contain harmful or bad cholesterol as previously claimed, rather its fat content contributes to the increase of various ailments such as heart disease and high blood pressure.

Good afternoon.
Eating is a pleasurable act that gives something to see but it costs a lot of money nowadays.
If there is no meat, no fish, the less privileged runs into the bush and plucks vegetables to eat.
A wealthy person never experiences poverty initially because, as the Igbo people often say, a lion is never scared at first sight.
But today, using two heads to cook is seen as a sign of wealth because of its high market price.
Eggs are a good source of protein, calcium, selenium, magnesium and they provide blood.
Car.
Money is food for both the poor and the rich.
Eating food, especially when you're hungry, is like feeding the world from your mouth or when money is scarce at first.
Are you asking if their children are at school that they will teach you how to make pancakes, stew, or gari to help them sustain their lives?
Now, the car is at the market.
The wealthy man and the miser are disputing over the price of one bag of garri that they are calling a 'painter', which is more than five hundred naira (N500).
The one who specializes in cancer treatment at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr Remi Ajekigbe, said that why many Nigerians are getting cancer now is because they no longer eat our local food such as garri, which has fibre, but they eat foreign foods.
Message.
Advice is a good meal that nourishes the body.
Advice is another meal known to the poor but many rich people ignore it.
The warning gives protection but also gives punishment.
The nutritionists on matters of food and what they recommend say that it is better to consume less meat because it does not contain the harmful substance called Cholesterol.
Breadfruit.
Sleep is a necessary restorative period for the strong warrior in battle.
Palm fruit used to be the food that the hunters eagerly looked forward to at first due to the hunger they were battling with, but now, it is only those with money that eat palm fruit.
Eggs provide protein, iron, potassium and other nutrients that the body needs.
Boil the yam.
The yam has fibre.
Yam is the food that people never get tired of at first because it does not quickly fill up the stomach like yam.
Only the poor chased after him begging.
But today, many people are included among the wealthy who eat it.
People who have diabetes should not eat sugar.
Researchers suggest that water yam contains fibre, small amounts of sodium and large amounts of potassium, which make it good for people managing high blood pressure.
Remember that 'fiber' aids digestion, large 'sodium' facilitates high blood pressure, where 'potassium' regulates blood pressure, preventing people from having kidney stones.
Sorry, the provided sentence "Isha" doesn't seem to be a complete or comprehensible sentence in Igbo language. Could you provide more context or check the spelling?
The hawk has a large mouth which it cannot use to finish another animal's food.
Those without money struggle to eat when they lack resources to buy meat or fish, and now, food has become expensive for those with money due to the high market cost.
What people use to mock the poor.
Like an oracle about food and the things it does, Dr Florence Uchendu explained that the reason why many people are suffering from diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer in Nigeria today is more potent than before.
The health system in Nigeria is not as advanced as in our foreign countries.

The tortoise said that it inherited strength from Nri where the Igbo originated, but it insisted that the matter concerning the source of Igbo water is a spiritual matter that should not be trifariously handled.
He left the town of Aguleri for Igboukwu community because they were continuously spreading a false narrative about the origin of the Igbo land, and he needed to correct them before it spiraled out of control.

He said that before peace would be restored in Nigeria, the spread of disease will stop abruptly.
Bishop Kukah spoke and asked: 'No money can buy peace.'

It's not the lack of money causing unrest in Nigeria, but rather the unequal distribution of wealth in the country.
They are wasting a lot of money on unnecessary leadership issues.
It means he put in a lot of money is not a problem, it only remains that everything in a country is money like Nigeria.
The government is wasting a lot of money on water, yet we don't have water.

What will bring peace to Nigeria is not arms and ammunition.
He suggested that one of the ways leaders can be effective is by being able to make another plan and being capable of doing things that will benefit people.
Bishop Kukah said that the government's job is to ensure that those they govern have peace of mind and security.
But many Nigerians don't have it.
The situation where this is threatening his self-reliance, we are living in it.

Rochas Okorocha is broke.
Okorocha is accusing the APC party leader of causing confusion in Imo.
One of the leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo state is Owelle Rochas Okorocha who is famous for his accusation that the party's leadership is unjust.
Okorocha complained that the APC chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun, did not respect the court order concerning the crisis that will determine who will lead their party and who will run for governorship in Imo.
In Bolaji Abdullahi's document, a letter written by the APC, the APC accused Okorocha of presenting them as worthless, and stated that they did not have any legal documents because he had squandered the ownership.
Okorocha insists that the APC leaders held a meeting.
Has Okorocha finished his term as Imo State Governor?
APC's house is on fire: It is PDP that did this - Onwuemeodo.
Abdullahi said 'Dragging hand in the progress of Imo is greater than Oyegun not winning a court case' the truth is not in him.
Because of this, we are advising the Imo governor to stop spreading these kinds of false allegations.
"In the ongoing crisis in Nigeria, where they are critically evaluated one after the other, and individuals who will participate in the party at different states across the country, those involved in it are the National Working Committee (NWC) in line with party law," the press release stated.
The APC has given Okorocha a lifeline by sowing discord in their ranks, thereby saving him from any potential trouble or blockade.
Remember that Okorocha and some APC members in Imo state had problems regarding how the selection process was done to decide who would lead the party in Imo and the support he gives to the man earmarked to take over leadership of Imo when he steps down.

Community unity is very important in Igbo land.
The Igbo people had their own system of governance and ruling before the whites came to introduce a different system of kings and queens that varies.

But this doesn't mean that the Igbo lack a sophisticated political system in the past.

One thing the Igbo people are doing.
The nobles and others - The nobles and others are the most respected in the community, they are judges who deal in word disputes.
They are discussing all matters concerning the community development.
They are the ones who uphold the tradition and justice of the land, ensuring that judgment is fairly made and everyone is treated honestly.
Before someone joins a group, they will be their expert, studying the land based on what they've seen and what they've been told.
He (or She) led men into battle in the past, and has victoriously done so many times, even when outnumbered.
They are being awarded high honors in the Igbo land where those in one group and others are being crowned, signifying that they are the decision-makers in the society because the eagle is the most beautiful bird in Igbo land.
Their clean clothes reveals the purity in their heart, in their speech, and in their judgements.
Their ceremonial cap is always off and visible as a sign of their pains and struggles in the war their community is battling with.
It gives them double peace; the title holders and the freeborn.
The nobles surpassed the others in wealth.
These are the male descendants from different families in a community.
They are the ones handling various disputes in the community concerning the welfare and progress of the town.
It is the kinsmen who perform the rites and if anyone commits a taboo, they are the ones who go to the shrine to inquire about the deity's disposition regarding the community or their households.
Every family has their kindred where every dispute like land matters, matters of the heart, disputes involving marrying a woman and abominable acts like murder, stealing, committing perjury or adultery are settled.
Every complaint they made was unheard in all the lands.
The siblings are seen as different members of a family.
The Daughters - This group is a group of women in the community, where women gather to discuss matters concerning their families, their husbands, and their children.
The daughters are called to a peace trial every time there is a dispute in the community and no matter what they decree, it is never contested.
The daughters are indeed the ones who ensure peace among their brothers and their wives, so that there is unity in the home.
The daughters included both the women born in the family and the women married into the family.
This is a fraternity - This is a place where people like these men are born at the same time.
They are the ones responsible for the management of the entire town.
They are indeed the ones who go to war or fight every time a war breaks out.
They are the ones blocking the way, rain and market but it does not mean that rain has spoiled the market or that rain has permanently blocked the way.
They are indeed bringing out everything that the family or groups of noble and other people have contributed as if there is someone they will chase out of the community or someone they will crown.
They will suffer to see that the person has arrived safely in the country before they can relax their hands.
A masquerade - one masquerade is one that only those who helped it dress up can follow.
They are working on a project that the early risers see as a scheme in the town.
Every time there is an incident like this, a masquerade going to greet its mother in that land is proof that no one will agree for it to enter that land until something is done about it.

Oscars 2018: In South Africa and Nigeria.
BBC reported that those who make films in Nigeria are involving more Hollywood actors in their movies, but this does not mean that the latter are becoming more popular than the former in Hollywood.

Where Nollywood owns itself as the second largest film industry in the world releasing over 1000 films in a single year, Hollywood may not have that quantity but it surpasses them in the quality that the whole world looks up to, producing excellent films.

He said that it was his wish for his son Charles to attend the CHOGM for one day.
But it's not what the Queen is showing her child or if she's lost and she's dead.
Eyes are being kept on Commonwealth leaders over who will lead them as they are meeting at Windsor Castle but it is still unclear what will be the outcome of that meeting.

Ebere Iwuji is a person who insists on discussing issues about the news she told BBC Igbo in an interview that this fee is a fee that will only be paid once.
It was reported that money will be used to support various projects in several towns within Imo state to aid them in their activities.
It is incomprehensible that the news is saying a thousand naira is like a hundred in a town, Nzewuji said that there is no name for the current money because it is those in the country now who agreed to accept such.
"The elder says 'This money will not enter into the Imo state government's purse, it is the various communities called Community Government Council (CGC) that will own it'."
The governor has announced that the Imo state government will spend billions of naira to equip every town with these facilities, so that they can prevent their community from lacking anything that other towns desire.
It is believed that anyone who desires progress should be supported, starting from where they initially get involved in community development work, as Nzewuji said.

Olusegun Obasanjo assumed office in the year 1999.
Many members of the ruling party APC and others are saying that Nigeria is sinking and attributing this decline to Buhari's party leadership in 2019.
The story is saying that many parties have started to register in an attempt to stop every change and progress that is oncoming.
The people included in this alliance are parties such as: 'Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), certain leaders in the All Progressives Congress(APC), Social Democratic Party,' among other smaller parties totaling two to three.

The masquerade entered the market shouting 'My glory spirit'.
Those who celebrate mass for the dead have accused the Catholic Church in Uke, Anambra state of claiming many plots of land and building three churches.
The youths are dancing the masquerade.
The masquerade festival is a traditional event known to the Igbo people.
The masqueraders are performing a ceremony, 'Water Pathway' in Uke located at the heart of Idemili North in Anambra state, attracted Catholic church prayer groups and lined up more than three hundred cars, drawing the attention of many people, where they believed one of their favorite people died on Saturday.
The leader of that church assembly is Father Emmanuel Obimma, known as 'Ebube Mmuonso' among other clergymen, and the women who prepared the food came there to serve the converts who came to pray to God in their church service they held on Friday night and early Saturday morning.
The reverend priest Francis Okoye told a BBC reporter that ghosts have invaded the church's night service, in something like a three-day screen that has seen many people scared and abandoning more than three lands of the community.
Aguleri and Igboukwu are not the origin of the Igbo people.

He alleged that the Uke parishioners did this because they were 'Way of the Cross', emphasizing that although masquerades usually come out twelve times in a day, these masquerades only come out where church services are being held in the evening to whip out the twelve strokes of the hour.
They insisted on counting those who use earth roads, those who came to church, their money and their properties.
The masquerade dances in many compounds in that association.
Our workers have demonstrated their ability to accomplish tasks but when we see things going wrong, we call the experts.
They came and destroyed everything in their path.
The council of elders in Anambra state claimed that the masquerade had beaten a worshipper in Uke but they also stated that no one died.
The spokesperson for the health department in that state, Nkiru Nwode, told BBC that 'We have recorded three deaths, we are investigating what happened there'.
The story told is not the first of the town's inhabitants resisting the group's proposal to enforce Catholic rituals, especially observance of the Friday fast exceeding two thousand a week.
The people living there said that the landlords in that town were exploiting the traders and the churchgoers by overcharging them, and were also dodging certain things.
Furthermore, they accused my father Obimma's worker of using that axe to kill those innocent victims and they left him during the town's king and elder's war meeting.
The elders and custodians are counting the participants attending that church service too.

Ezeife: The Igbos will support Buhari again.
Ezeife and some elites are insisting in an Igbo conversation endorsing Buhari to achieve presidency in 2023 is a falsehood.
Chukwuemeka Ezeife is an elder among the Igbo people.
Chukwuemeka Ezeife, from Igbo-Ukwu, is a former governor of Anambra State and a prominent advocate for the Igbo people in Nigeria.
The people who hold power in the Igbo land have maintained that Igbo descendants will support President Buhari in the 2019 elections just as they did in 2015.
They promised the Igbo people in public that they would support Buhari to serve a second term in office in 2019 and that the promise to hand over power to an Igbo woman is a mundane talk, because it is a baseless claim.
In particular, many APC members including the Minister and Transport Head Rotimi Amaechi, the Secretary to the Government Boss Mustafa, and the head of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, told the Igbo people to support Buhari in 2019, so he would support them in 2023.
Give the Igbo farmers 2019 - Balarabe Musa.
They are oppressing the Igbo people as those who lost in the war.
However, some of those who spoke in Igbo argued that the said speech was a strategy to get Igbo votes, stating that people like Buhari had abandoned the Igbo people because of his 2015 manifesto, and that they would not support him in the 2019 election.
In his interview at their home, the Sun newspaper reported, former Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife said: 'It's not going to be like that..
We believe that we should respect the rights of insane people.
My belief is that we should respect God, who knows that if an Igbo person is considered a shepherd, the Fulani person should be happy, the Yoruba person should be happy, and all ethnic groups in Nigeria should be satisfied because we will improve Nigeria's economy together.
The talk about 2023 is not honest, everyone speaking it is to deceive the Igbo people.
In one hand, the leader of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dozie Ikedife, said that the Igbos are those who honor their word to maintain a pact that will not fail at the last minute.
He told his family in a Sunrise newspaper article: 'Many promises were made to the Igbos when they came, but our fathers were deceived.
If someone offends you twice or thrice, they come a fourth time, you should be wise.
This land's strength has exhausted a person.
Ikedife came forward and said: 'What matters to me is how we can achieve a peaceful Biafra without breaking the law or harming anyone.'.
Remembering back to 2015, many Igbos didn't give Buhari a vote of confidence, which resulted in him not giving 95 percent of the support to those who did not vote for him, and 5 percent to those who did vote for him. This has caused a lot of debate among those who have been politically conscious since he came into power.

Wole Soyinka is also the author of this document, making a plea to Nigerians to not turn a blind eye, urging them to stand against the corrupt leaders that have held them down, especially in the forthcoming general elections in 2019.
Soyinka, who spoke about this yesterday in a remembrance event of the deceased activist known as Gani Fawehinmi, which took place in Lagos, stated that Nigeria's actual political condition is problematic.
He said that those blaming Nigeria's current woes on their ancestors should rethink, estimating themselves as pioneers guiding the way forward, but urged Nigerians not to rest on their past laurels but to give room for new leaders to emerge.

What happened that Nigerians will not allow travel to America?
The Nigerian government is discussing with them about the incident at the meeting of those who want to invest in Nigeria and the ministers present in America.
Yemi Osibanjo is in Abuja.
Yemi Osibanjo said that those whose names are on the paper are the leaders.
Many who watch the Nigerian government express their disappointment that the affiliation they have with Nigeria and America is not visible in Washington DC's events.
The government officials did not ensure that the people living in Nigeria did not receive financial support from foreign countries.

The heat of the sun is turning the wine into money.
Switzerland has returned the stolen Abacha money.
One of the things this government has done is to dethrone the Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido, who was a viable contender for the highest political office in Nigeria.
What Sanusi said.
Sanusi stated that the one who invests money in Africa, 'has Nigeria, has Ghana, has Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa'.
He boldly stated, 'Nigeria has the potential to outperform all others in terms of productivity, but it is like saying I will invest 500 dollars in Nigeria, 100 dollars in Ghana, 100 dollars in Rwanda, 100 dollars in Cote D'Ivoire, to achieve maximum earnings.'
We have come for us and the wealthy to invest in the country, we must start at the grassroots, we will start at the grassroots level.
When I reached that place, they called me the future of Nigeria.
Those who attended the meeting were there, the herdsmen were not present, the ministers were not present, Sanusi said.
Sanusi said that this is not good, because it shows that Nigeria is not improving based on what he's saying.
He said, "You call people to come and see how things are hard in Nigeria, but you don't.."
This is not how to attract investors to Nigeria.
If it happens to be that Rwandans are not part of this organization, their leader Kagame will stay in that position telling people away from Rwanda.
People have voiced their opinions on social media.

However, the government argued that it's not the way it is.
Lai Mohammed is a minister who has a reputation for spreading false information and it is not true that those who want to join him will not be disappointed.
Mohammed is complaining that the ministers are attending the meeting without papers given to them, or staying in Washington DC when the meeting is going on.
He said that the Minister of Labour, responsible for electricity and financial creation, does not have documents denying that their names are in the list of those who will speak at the conference.
The Minister of Development went with the governor to a meeting of Commonwealth leaders held in London.
The minister is in Washington DC for a meeting concerning financial matters, but it is for a global banking conference with the IMF.
He warned in advance that the minister is concerned about the news and tradition contained in the document, but he hastily informed those in charge of the meeting that he would not worry about his other responsibilities.
Lai Mohammed said that 'These things have shown that it's not right to say that the ministers are not part of his team.

Ikeogu Oke received a hundred thousand dollars as the winner of the Nigerian prose competition in 2017.
The one who won the prize as the best novel writer in Nigeria in 2017 is Ikeogu Oke, and he stated that the Igbo language will not die and the Igbos should regard it as important.
Ikeogu won a prize of 100 thousand dollars as the ultimate winner of Nigeria's award called 'Nigerian Prize of Literature' for his work entitled "The Heresiad".
The unique thing about that document is that it was written in the dialect that the Igbo people use in their poetry.
In his radio broadcast at BBC Igbo, Mr. Oke spoke about the preservation of the Igbo language, believing that it was his responsibility.
The government is discussing what to do with the Abacha loot.
Kemi Adeosun is the minister in charge of things related to finance explaining how the government will use Abacha's money in Nigeria.
Kemi Adeosun and Christine Lagarde are the leaders at the IMF.
The Nigerian government has agreed to use the recovered Abacha loot, which the Swiss government returned, amounting to three billion dollars.
The Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, stated that the said funds will be used to fight terrorists as President Buhari had promised when he was campaigning for presidency.
He mentioned that the place where he facilitates news updates and promotes the development of financial sectors across the world is the IMF, located in Washington, America.
Adeosun further said that the money in question is stashed in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that is nicknamed the Clean-Up Fund, to support initiatives that would assist the poor.

In the message he was reading, he stated that the central government is confident that their plans are in place, and things would get better for Nigeria.
'With these measures being considered, Nigeria's economy is bound to improve.'
What is Nigeria presenting at CHOGM?
An Igbo person has won Big Brother Naija.
Will Nigerians not travel to America?
The three things involve a lot of money exchange.
The IMF advised Nigeria to adjust its exchange rate to be uniform, a place where economists say there is monkey business.
Naira.
The EFCC said that Umar stole ten thousand naira.
To strengthen the Nigerian currency change, the IMF has advised Nigeria on how to implement its currency reform.
Nigeria has several groups calling for changes; one for those involved in the oil business in Nigeria, one for the extreme Islamists going on a holy war in Saudi Arabia, one for the Christian believers going to the holy land, another for those in offices in foreign countries that the government has dismissed.
As renowned speakers Pat Utomi and Uche Uwaleke told the BBC in detail, there are many economic changes afoot.
Read the letter containing many financial changes.
He is vomiting.
Pat Utomi explained that "Someone might have money in a foreign land and take it to sow in the stock market, but the person who needs that money to gather materials to start a market in our land doesn't know anyone who won't steal it from him."
It is not good for pride.
Where Abacha's money will go.
Currency exchange: How much is a dollar in Naira?
In his statement, Uche Uwaleke gave an example, saying, 'Like when the government's exchange rate is N305, if it devalues a person's currency, it might end up reducing the buying power to N365, resulting in hardship. But if there is just one exchange rate, you can't manipulate it.'
He is making a fire, adding pepper and preparing something in the town.
Uwaleke said that having a lot of money causes many to change in many undesirable ways.
The only thing they will do is spend lavishly, without making plans.
He is distributing wealth amongst the people in the community.
Utomi said that if people are spending money to send their children overseas for education, it would make everyone want to send their kids overseas, our local schools would become extinct in the land.
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their impeachment.
Ekweremadu 'increases his wealth'.
They are entrusting Nigeria into Ekweremadu's hands again.
The total number of Senators is 109, if 108 are against Ekweremmadu today, it means that they are all against him.
Remember that the Senate committee met today for workers to report to the senate president's office, which is Ike Ekweremadu immediately, where they were called today.
Ekweremadu left his house this morning to attend a major trade union meeting, where 14 trade unionists left APC for PDP.
Uche Anichukwu, the spokesperson for Ekweremadu, told BBC Igbo that EFCC arrested him at his home in Abuja, not DSS as we first reported.
@MrBanksOmishore is the aide to Bukola Saraki, who posted the EFCC's document that was served to Ekweremadu this morning, on Twitter.
In that letter, the EFCC stated that they want to investigate Ekweremadu for attending meetings, using his influence and involvement in foreign money laundering.
When Saraki entered the Senate and started the 'plenary', he spoke in the absence of Ekweremadu, and stated that it was necessary to prevent an observation of his public leadership becoming invalid.
Sam Anyanwu said that he and Ekweremadu were absent, but there are no documents showing that their constituents are looking for them.
During the 'plenary', the legislators unanimously tasked the deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, in particular, to have the strength to overcome his challenges.
In the morning, Saraki said that the burglars broke into his house.
Furthermore, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, has instructed those who belong to APC to come out today so that he can visit them properly.
He said this from his Twitter handle, which is @MBuhari.
The EFCC has arrested Ekweremadu in Abuja.
The spicy matter that EFCC is investigating in Ekweremadu's house.
They know those who request and kill Catholic Church sacraments death penalty.
The high court acquitted those accused and sentenced Father John Adeyi to death penalty due to terrorism.
The hospital treats the sick more than the offenders.
The high court in Makurdi, Benue state has sentenced two people, Hartuna Idi and Suleiman Gina, to death for the killing of Father John Adeyi, whom they kidnapped and killed over a ransom issue.
Remember that four people, including Saidu Abdullahi and Aliyu Garba, asked Father Adeyi, the vicar-general of the Catholic Church in Otukpo Diocese, Benue State, to kill him and bury his body in a sacred forest in Otukpo in 2016.
The thing I'm holding belongs to the useless ones.
They have appointed Mikel Obi's father as the leader of the other group.
But when the young men grew tired of him, they revealed that they had sold his Honda Civic car for one-point-seven million naira (N1.7m) as scrap, but they killed him when they heard that the townsfolk were about to rescue him from where they had detained him.
One of them confessed that he shot him, where two people witnessed his death trial today, Wednesday.
The news from UkoChukwu's family home reached Daily Post; they have spent a year in fear and in court, and their lawsuit has resulted in an outbreak of fear.
But they were filled with anger and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Adeyi, the firstborn.
The senators are attacking Ekweremadu.
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their impeachment.
APC is paying the price for their disastrous leadership - Okachamara.
Does a spirit live in a child that is born headfirst into the world?
The Igbo tradition spoke about hair braiding in the olden days and it is still in vogue today.
In ancient times, the Igbos had a belief that people with dreadlocks possessed mystical powers.
Every newborn child in the house brings immense joy to everyone's heart.
But there are several places in Igbo land where a newborn infant with dreadlocks might inspire a dance.
The people of this town like Igbuzo (Ibusa) in Delta state, where the children are seen as precious as gold.
Who is the smart leader?
The curious tale arose that the newborn baby's hair turned dreadlocked because his mother confessed to an encounter with a spirit in this land, who allegedly gave her a child.
Will you finish eating this food that spoiled a long time ago?
Do you know that the Igbo people value time immensely?
They have a belief that the dots in the hair are a mark the spirits gave to the child they would recognize him by.
They call these children 'Ezenwa'.
They have mutual agreement that their leader is their pillar.
Just as they've started to gain confidence, a child with untidy hair will become a child who does good in the world because his god has given him strength in his chest, they are gaining real power, and they will eventually become a hero who causes great fear in times of war.
But many problems are plaguing the leaders.
He is combing his nice curly hair.
The Holy Spirit dwells in my head.
Many among these brethren, believe that a child born with a lot of hair will become either extremely wealthy or die if he goes into a forest at dawn.
It is a problem when a normal person tries to instruct a genius.
Everyone should do what is necessary to give the child money immediately or keep the money in his or her head.
Only that event will stop that child from eating too much food.
It is only the mother of that child who can satiate the child's hair with palm.
Ceremony of shaving off the dreadlocks.
The story said that it was traditional healers that shaved the child's dreadlocks.
Now, many people are using jewelry and fancy headgear to show off.
That child will replay the game, assuming the child is speaking.
His family will ask him what he wants to use to have his hair done.
Everything he wants on that day will be given to him.
Church of Christ.
All the Igbo land is where the faith of the Church of Christ should be well established.
This has caused many Igbo traditions to change constantly.
Nowadays, many Igbo parents do not believe in the existence of a child being born with dreadlocks.
But they are referring to that child as if he should go to the market as the adults make him pray.
Doctor Anthony Mgbolu told BBC Igbo that headache is what is prevalent in that family.
The Igbo tradition speaks for the wise leaders.
The convener of a program on Africa and languages at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, told BBC Igbo that there was a time in Igboland when no one ever doubted the intelligence of those with dreadlocks.
Nnabuihe should show strength, if it happens that the Igbo in the long past had doubts in their minds, they should give him a name.
In his words: 'Dada is the name the Yoruba people gave him.
The Igbo people plait their hair well because they have competition with the Yoruba people.
But why is the head scarce in abundance?
Nnamdi Daniels is someone who does movie work.
Many people we asked claimed there is nothing wrong with dreadlocks but in reality, many people still view those with dreadlocks as troublemakers.
Nnamdi Daniels is a man who told BBC Igbo that he has grown his hair out of love for it, and his dreadlocks for the love he has for his hair.
In his speech, he said: 'I'll tell you about the time I travelled to all the towns in Niger State.
The barber started cutting my hair when I asked him questions about my dandruff. This situation made me very embarrassed.
The government has banned Codeine cough syrup beyond two days.
The Ministry is worried about the growing abuse of Codeine cough syrup beyond the two eyes and is also paying attention to others.
Codeine Drug.
Drug addicts are abusing a lot of codeine.
The central government announced that they have banned the sale of cough syrup containing codeine in Nigeria due to its excessive presence in the market.
The Minster of Health, Okammuta Isaac Adewole, said this when his committee inquired about the Codiene crisis that came to his attention.
It was reported that this is due to the government's strong belief and determination in their fight against codeine abuse in Nigeria.
Codeine Cough Syrup: A drug that has been excessively abused.
Nafdac has seized Emzor's drugs and others.
Adewole said that their household and the market they see for food and medicine called National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control in English are those that administer and inspect this.
Remembering what happened this year, the BBC exposed the rampant illegal drug trade of codeine syrup in Nigeria.
It is the delay in presenting this proposal that led the government to declare that they will regulate the amount and price of this drug.
The government is saying that enabling everyone to have access to free health care is the real cause of my suffering.

What do the Igbos use to build these houses?
The thing that makes the Igbo use to chase people into the bush.
The forest meeting is where the Igbos love the land but it is a problem they are problematizing those they chased into that forest.
Masquerades.
Igbos believe in different kinds of spirits.
What made Igbo people call the forest a forest?
Do you know that the forest meetings are still held today in Igbo land?
What is jungle justice?
The lecturer in African Languages and Literature at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, told BBC Igbo that the Igbo call it the spirit of the forest, not a forest curse as many people refer to it today.
Just as the Igbo traditionally believe, the spirit forest is where they worship their gods on earth.
This place where they discuss everyone's land is a congress.
In the Igbo land, God is considered paramount, but the spirits assisting Him are the Earth.
Nnabuihe explained that in the Igbo land, the Earth is believed to give birth to everything that exists in the world.
Does a spirit live in a child that is born headfirst into the world?
Will you finish eating this food that spoiled a long time ago?
The land is cursed (cursed land is destruction).
Igbos believe in God, see everything as a result of His creation, implying that there is no evil you will overlook in His sight.
There has been deforestation in Igbo land up until now.
This land will make this person sick severely.
Observe how the earth disease is causing its people harm.
Leprosy.
Four years.
Dropsy.
Hernia.
Nnabuihe announced at that time, there would be no doctor coming to treat these patients we referred to.
Everyone should reveal the type of illness they have before it gets worse.
If he does not confess the evil he has done, they will leave him in the spirit forest.
Do you know that the Igbo people value time immensely?
The things you don't want to do in Igbo culture.
Other things like marrying another wife or husband, or trying to fertilize an egg and contracting a contagious disease can make the Land curse the person.
Human sweat is not bad.
Just as Nnabuihe used to fend, this man's struggle is for the sake of his children and his household.
The church of Christ is a common belief in the Igbo land.
Igbo people have long held the belief that everyone who arrives, has arrived bearing the earth goddess's goodwill to his family.
Where is the forest spirit in Igbo land today?
The need for Mbaise in Imo state.
There is a fire deity in Okija.
The land is vast.
Ihiala.
Okija Shrine.
Igbo culture is fading away.
Nnabuihe said that this thing is the worst happening now in Igboland.
He said: 'The traditional practices in the Igbo land died when Christianity came to igbo land, people have forgotten many of these rituals, no one teaches these rituals anymore'.

Many Nigerians are complaining about the lack of electricity.
The Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said that the electricity production in Nigeria has increased to over 7000 megawatts.

Fashola is in Calabar where the heads of departments and agencies are holding a meeting.
He stated that the project to establish gas flaring did not improve the condition of the electrical grid in Nigeria as it was when they started the project in 2015.
Fashola is holding three portfolios in Buhari's government.
Three years have passed, the report is that the issue of power outage is a big problem we have in Nigeria.
At that time, those making money were saying that they had nothing to give to the children of Nigeria.
At that time, we were generating 2,690 megawatts for Nigerians, but the report became contentious.
What we have today is 5,222 megawatts, which is the highest Nigeria has ever generated.
Currently, the output is 7000 megawatts, and it is expected to remain at 7000.
There is a problem, but we will say that we are moving forward.

Many times, people ask what is appropriate to use in decorating a woman's body in traditional Igbo society, this story explains it.

They broadcast news about some criminals or kidnappers seeing themselves as husband and wife, but they violated the normal marriage rites as they should have.
The woman living in that house is always seen whenever strange things happen in this vicinity, it's almost as if she has nothing else to do traditionally.

Due to this practice, in some communities in Igboland, it became a rule that a man would have to marry his wife and give birth to her in full, a situation that does not happen when he is alive.
The thing used to adorn a woman's body.
In Igbo land, it is not considered that a man married a woman unless he has paid her bride price.
If indeed he did the judgement, they believe he will come to discuss things like the child's owners chose to.
As explained in the conversation about traditions by Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (the second Duruagwu) from Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State, to BBC Igbo, this law is very beneficial in their community, especially to those who are visually impaired in different ways.
One who does not value life, trades it for death, is a practice many societies engage in.
But in Akokwa town in Imo State, it is not the norm, where a family gives birth to a girl and it becomes their responsibility to take her corpse to her husband's house.
The woman is mourning her dead.
That person will come and tell my children that their child has a fever (they shouldn't assume that he is notifying them of a death).
They will follow him to give their 'letter' to their child, when they see the corpse, they will deny that the man in question is the one that killed their child, which will cause him to free his leg and hand.
To show that he didn't kill her, he would perform the woman's funeral rites.
He will come to meet him.
He will continue to protect my children and his wife forever.
That man will go ahead to perform his funeral rites.
Something will happen to the man who marries a woman in haste.
As Nze Ukaejuoha narrated, these are the things that will happen to anyone who marries a woman without knowing what is in her head.
That person will encounter dissimilar obstacles on the way.
The bad thing behaves differently and frustrates the person.
Things do not always go well for someone in that situation.
That person had the power to die from shame.
But that person can refuse, whether if all these bad things begin to happen to him.
What that person will do is yet unknown.
Assuming that the man has stopped laughing and is feeling embarrassed because of the foot injury he's having, here's what he should do:
That person will consult their community elders before they come to make the land dispute.

Nigeria 2019 elections: The candidacy of those contesting for the Presidential seat - Muhammadu Buhari.
The President of Nigeria is Muhammadu Buhari, serving his second term in office expressing his ideas in party meetings.
President Muhammadu Buhari.
Muhammadu Buhari is seeking a third term to become the president of Nigeria.
It was in December 1983 (1984) that the Nigerian military took power, but some of his colleagues overthrew Buhari in 1985.
I'm listening to BBC News right now.
Buhari who left office as a military dictator in 1985, only to return in 2015 on a democratic mandate, has struggled to secure a third term in office.
Just like when he behaves like a tyrant, Buhari has no further name pertaining to anyone's strength.
Despite the persistent denial of their intentions, many people are insisting that Buhari should not abandon them like a court would do.
This man, who was 76 years old in 2015, is confident that he will undergo a major surgery successfully and recover, thereby improving Nigeria's health statistics.
Four years are coming and going but many people do not understand what it entails.
He made a vow that he would defeat Boko Haram, waging war in Nigeria, and free those who want to escape from the painful grip of the deep shadows and sun-setting hills of Nigeria, but in all this, they are still powerfully protesting against President Buhari's leadership in the presidential palace because of the way they are handled.
Their words insinuate that Buhari will resign from his party leadership role because they don't govern or execute their namesake promise - the PDP spokesperson, Atiku Abubakar, is indeed a guilty scapegoat and considers Nigeria's greatness like Buhari.
Buhari is a prominent figure in the All Progressives Congress (APC) known as a pillar of integrity amidst a plethora of corruption in Nigeria, regardless of many people doubting the genuineness of his election victory due to widespread vote fraud suspicion.

Imo Election Results: The thing that surprised Uche Nwosu most.
Only Uche Nwosu came to BBC Igbo to talk about the governorship in Owerri, Imo state.
Igbo was spoken in Owerri when BBC Igbo organized the church service for the people training to become the governor of Imo state but what concerned the people of Imo is that only one person amongst them agreed to the BBC Igbo's promise that they would come to broadcast that church service.
The voices advocating for APC members in Imo state are promoting Uche Nwosu.
Imo APC Primaries: Uche Nwosu has been declared the candidate for Imo governorship.
These people contesting for the Imo state governorship are Emeka Ihedioha from PDP, Hope Uzodimma from APC, and Ifeanyi Ararume from APGA.
The head of BBC Igbo, Adline Okere, said that it was only Ararume who informed her that he could not come because he was currently sorting out his voting issues.
The event started by him throwing two seeds at the same time.
In that presentation, Uche Nwosu pledged to pay three hundred million naira as monthly salaries if the central government would support him.
Nwosu insisted that his party has no one contesting the presidency as he included in his speech about the support he is giving to President Muhammadu Buhari.
Another thing he said is; 'There is nothing at all in my 'manifesto' that I will not do.'.
The statement that Uche Nwosu made caused a lot of controversy.
Uche Nwosu left APC for AA to pursue the governorship position in Owerri, Imo state.
Nwosu has outlined what he will do for the people of Imo State and he has pledged that his administration and implementation will commence in March 2019.
Buhari for President: 'One AA has the potential to elect Uche Nwosu'.
It's not true that Action Alliance has rejected Uche Nwosu - Obidiche.

The story is important.
Members of the PDP and supporters of Atiku Abubakar gathered at the Nnamdi Azikiwe international airport in Abuja to receive Abubakar, who returned from America.
Atiku and the Nigerian House Leader Bukola Saraki met twice in that country where Atiku resides, informing the government workers of that country and the general public that they have a partnership.
Atiku will participate in the debate of those running for president happening on Saturday in Abuja.
The fire in their house made them run out of Guinness beer.
A fire broke out at the Guinness factory in Osisioma Industrial Layout, Aba, Abia state on Friday.
That fire which lasted for twelve hours was fought by the local firefighters, and other local houses nearby, villagers and inhabitants of that town also helped to quench it.
Nike Onakoya, speaking about Guinness through the BBC Igbo, said that the fire did not harm anyone and what she was doing was of great importance.
He reported that their wine production work is faring well in their locations in Benin and Ogba, Lagos Breweries.
There is nothing surprising or significant about what happened like the shutdown in Aba because it is meant for business owners and only those few people.
The place where we started selling our palm wine is close to our house in Benin and Ogba (Lagos).
It's a false story that they want to kill Onnoghen.

The family of the former Nigerian Chief Justice Onnoghen have reported him missing.

In his interview with BBC Yoruba, former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo spoke about the main contender and potential leader in the upcoming 2019 elections, Atiku Abubakar.
He said that his assumption now is that Atiku will surpass Buhari because of what Buhari has done.
The people they have in their midst are members of APC and PDP.
Based on everything I saw in Buhari's rule - no development, massive unemployment, inflation, weak economy, weak ideology and all the other things included, Atiku is better.
Atiku will defeat Buhari with more than two votes.
It talked about Boko Haram and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
Obasanjo revealed that his support for President Muhammadu Buhari against Atiku was due to something that made him discard the urges of 73 people vying for Nigeria's presidency.

Unachukwu said that 'Server' is a computer that controls other computers, distributing individual pieces of information.
He said that Inec could claim they do not have a 'server' because they have another office where they store their data, but it is not true that they do not have a 'server' where they store data.
He said that the internet has its server where many people receive their information.
Unachukwu says that 'Inec will not say that they don't have server when they have a place they store data.
They can call this a 'database' but its essence is a storage place in that computer where other things that can process information or eject information from it are housed.
He said that Inec confirmed that they do not have a server.
They are calling on people to come with their PVCs as they are interested in the election.
Unachukwu said it would have been easier if he had cast his vote where he registered, and that Inec should have recognized him as a 'server'.
But they are capable of saying that they did not launch in 2019 and it is a 'server' that caused them not to do their work.

Mohammadu Buhari, the cattle herder, stated that the time when the cattle herder leader was Goodluck Jonathan was better, as the children's education was looked upon with great concern and anticipation.
He said this yesterday when he committed an offense in Dapchi town of Yobe State, where he kidnapped the children last year.
He criticized President Jonathan's handling of the Chibok girls’ kidnap in 2014 and said he was thoughtless.
These papers are requests.
But Buhari's speech has provoked various reactions from many people.
The person leading the 'Bring Back Our Girls' campaign is Sesugh Akume, saying that the government is not effective.
He lamented, "We're not happy, something like the three-year plea of the Chibok children, has now happened in Dapchi town as if President Buhari is repeating the mere mishap Jonathan had in his time."
He trained those children for three months, but now it's the government that goes there.
They denied all the allegations they made about releasing the Dapchi children.
The outlaw promised the parents of the Dapchi children that he would release the children they abducted.
Jonathan's aide, Reno Omokiri, said that Buhari's son, Yusuf Buhari, is wealthier than the Dapchi children.
He said that during the abduction of Chibok girls, Jonathan called a meeting of the rescuers, where during the time of Dapchi girls' abduction, Buhari had already met with the rescuers.
It was reported at the time that Yusuf Buhari had a severe motorbike accident and Buhari was filled with sorrow for all he had, but took his son to the hospital.

Is the naming ceremony a tradition that must be respected in Igbo land?
They bathed the newborn baby with warm water, palm oil, alligator pepper, and utazi leaves as was written in the letter his mother gave birth to him with. This is what is called the first bath.
The new child and his mother.
"Ọmụgwọ" is an Igbo tradition that has been practiced from ancient times up until the present day.
The 'Omugwo' in Igbo tradition is when a mother comes to nurture her daughter and the new child she has given birth to (which is her grandchild).
At times, if a woman doesn't have a mother (meaning her mother has passed away), her husband's mother or her stepmother will stay in her house to nurse her.
Things girls like.
The women have started plaiting hair in a new style.
The dignity of a woman is not in dispute.
The reason a woman is cherished more than a man is because it is believed that she understands herself better for she controls her own affairs.
The nursing period is a time the mother teaches her female child everything she knows about nurturing a new born.
Sometimes, when a child is born there, the mother comes to start her postnatal care.
The woman gave birth to a new baby with much strength while her mother watched over her child.
What the mother does during postnatal care.
The mother will give her daughter something that will make her sweat flow well.
The mother will cook her food and those who would make her cry will see her eat well.
The mother will bathe him with hot water for a year at the place where others desire, but she should also show him something that will scare him (like robb, aboniki).
The mother will feed the new baby, sometimes lull him to sleep and sometimes watch him sleep.
He will still cherish that new child, but his hand is already full.
He will see that his child is feverishly floating on a bucket filled with hot water and salt to cure a ailment, which would make the fever capable of receding.
He will be practicing it for a year so he can be able to dance it well before he goes in.
The mother will be raising her daughter alone because she and her spouse separated for the first time.
He will be doing other chores in the house like house cleaning and cooking that the family eats.
The pain of childbirth is intense.
Maternity leave is a time for a mother, her child, and her new grandchild to establish a good understanding of what is termed 'bonding' in English. For this reason, many mothers take the time to go wherever their child is born, at home or abroad, regardless of what it takes, including staying for three months or more.
He will be giving his daughter everything his daughter gave birth to, whether it's a baby boy or a baby girl.
Food is needed at the naming ceremony.
This woman is nursing and has food she eats. Among them is to use nutritious soup to supplement her diet during her postnatal period. These meals are both satisfying and varied.

The women of Ozubulu have done well.
The report said that the women of Ozubulu used masks to scare away the robbers who invaded the homes of widows in Amawbia.
People are the church members of St. Phillips in the past year.
The women of Ozubulu residing in Ekwusigo district in Anambra state have gone to the court of the elders in Amawbia to settle their dispute.
They did this in preparation for the trial of those who allegedly attacked the market in their town on August 6th last year.
They say that these people are afraid for their lives and that is why they want to resist those who would help bring to justice those who have wronged them.
They are a big document where it was written 'we want fair trial' 'we want the release of the prisoners in the court house'.
What the fugitive said about the Ozubulu massacre.
The spokesperson of the Anambra widows, Nkiruka Nwode told BBC Igbo that what matters to these women most is to have peace in their community.
The girl said that these women are doing this out of desperation as they're preparing to go to court due to the hunger that hit their community.
The head of widows in Anambra state, Garba Baba Umaru, gave these women support, telling them to move forward.
Umaru told those women that 'wherever I am, nothing will happen to you, I will ensure that you have received fair judgment'.
Something happened in Ozubulu.
The group from St. Phillips Catholic Church committed a massacre where they were holding service.
This incident claimed the lives of 11 people on the morning of August 6, 2017.
The story says that it is a protest in the midst of two people living in South Africa that caused this.
This has made the researchers from Nigeria and South Africa begin their investigation into the matter.
The delegates who raised the intense argument are: Onyebuchi Mbanefo, 46, Chukwudi Ugwu, 30, and Great Chinedu Akpunonu, 44.

Nkiru told the BBC correspondent about her extreme penury, suffering, bulky chores and the critical condition in the hands of her family and others.
The time I went home, my family told me that I had apparently been chosen to inherit the house but there was no man to hand it over to.

This is suggesting that dancing is a cultural tradition deeply rooted in Nigerian land.
But if a woman chooses not to wear the traditional attire and choses the Nigerian Sunflower dress instead, people look at her strangely, criticizing her, as if they have forgotten they once had a life.
What is covering it?
Like the scholars in the study called 'sociologists' in English explained, what oppresses or harms a person and his/her peers, especially if it does not favour women, is a culture and not a lack of understanding.
In his speech, Dr Adedeji Oyenuga, a Sociology lecturer at Lagos State University, pointed out that it is tradition and societal pressure that cause some parents to perceive not having a child as a failure and not loving their child unconditionally.
It is said in tradition. There is a time a child looks up to his/her mother and father, but when the child becomes mature, they start to understand the man's role and the woman's role. If the child doesn't do this, in particular if the child is a female, her mother and father will treat her as if they have dragged her on the ground in their community.
Dr Nkechi Emma-Echiegu is a lecturer at Ebonyi State University and she teaches culture.
In the Igbo land, it's said that the one who gives birth to a disobedient child, begs the one offended.
He went on to say that it is a bad tradition to keep silent or oppress the voiceless because of injustice.
Give what he said consideration.
What is happening at the moment?
Dr Adedeji Oyenuga said that what makes him amazed is a woman reading large volumes of books that could make men play and dance to her tune.
Another point is that women outperform men in entrepreneurship. It has been proven that men often leave places where they were born to other cities, outstripping the women who remain in the household of their husbands and, in their absence, begin to trade.
What is spoiling the soup is not lacking in the kitchen.
As Oyenuga once stated, the burden of women encompasses not just things like high alcohol consumption, grief, severe illness, the enormous stigmatization that the whites call 'depression', which can lead to suicide, domestic violence, among others.
Echiegu said that he is capable of assembling different types of radios, including radios with large brains, timer, alarm clock, speaker and death switch.
They said that having knowledge would end the bad tradition of treating a childless woman as if she has no value.

Patricia Ann Spann, who served 16 months and four years confessed that she and her daughter Misty Velvet Dawn Spann, aged 26, had a document and were guilty of her crime.
This woman's children were born before her mouth was shut in 2014.
They've enslaved themselves since the advent of the tradition of women attending to women's events and men attending to those of their fellow men in that village.
Investigators revealed that Patricia Ann Spann had married her son when he was 18 years old, where the young man died from severe injuries in 2010.

Misty Spann said that her mother told her she had a three-year illness that made her unaware of the implications of their relationship.
Patricia Ann Spann stated that she proceeded with their union believing it didn't break the law as her daughter's birth certificate didn't state her name as the mother when they reunited two years prior to their engagement.
Misty Spann pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud. She was given a ten-year sentence for investigation and involvement in the production of false knowledge and wisdom-related documents.

Igbo Proverb: What you don't know about the breadfruit you're eating.
Marriage is one ceremony that is highly respected in Igbo land, it is indeed an event that showcases Igbo culture.
Marriage.
They are peeling the breadfruit before it is cooked.
Many Igbos know the breadfruit tree but they do not know how to process breadfruit before it becomes edible.
The tree that produces a type of nut called 'breadfruit' in English is known as Ụkwa. Its nuts are ground into a flour, where the grains within are used to make what we call breadfruit.
When the palm tree branches become dry, one of them falls to the ground, and it is left to decay completely before another one is cut down. This practice led the Igbos to the proverb that 'when a palm frond becomes old, it falls'.
Before he eats bread, he will explore diverse ways.

How did you eat it?
They come from a place like Urualla in Imo state, where they don't throw away the water used to boil their breadfruit. They drink it as it is and eat their breadfruit as it is.
Some don't put palm oil in their food, where some leave their breadfruit in water, which means they soak it in water.
They are suggesting to split the breadfruit into four parts, use a local knife to cut it or use an English knife to cut it.
Many people use palm fronds to brush their teeth.
How is the breadfruit cooked?
The palm fruit is traditionally cooked first before it is stored in a bag for those who will come to press it for oil production.
Before you sew the one you called, soak it in water from night until the morning. This will make it stronger and prevent it from tearing when you start to sew it.
What he is offering there.
Scientific research has shown that breadfruit has many beneficial elements, like riboflavin, iron, niacin, thiamin, iron, and phosphorus. It contains potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, calcium, zinc, manganese, selenium, phosphorus and vitamin C.
It is good for a person's heart. Many use its tree bark to wash the head because it kills what the white man calls dandruff, and it prevents sleeplessness.
It contains a small amount of what the English call saturated fats, cholesterol and sodium.
Some are hearing the sound of the palm fruit in different places, some are eating it and drinking the juice.

The boy is taking strong medication, codeine.
The story says that dangerous leaders are creating a significant drug crisis as a gift.
The manufacturer of drugs in Nigeria, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, has suspended a worker but also denied any fault because their hands are involved in the illicit drug codeine trade, in a high-profile illegal way, as the BBC's exposé made the drug seen to be a threat to the lives of suffering Nigerians.
Emzor wants one of their market representatives who responded to the BBC drug report, Emzolyn syrup.
They said this on social media that BBC has reported what they did on Monday, the 30th day of April.
Due to the scarcity of that product, it's like one man from Emzor Pharmaceuticals is using the opportunity to sell people fake drugs.

Emzor has stopped them from going to the market and asked them to stay at work.
Emzor Pharmaceuticals is a manufacturer that prides itself on excellence and integrity.
They have a drug approval paper exceeding one hundred and twenty, including Emzolyn Codeine from NAFDAC.
They came forward and said: 'Emzolyn Codeine production has stopped and it will resume after a thorough review.'
In an interview with BBC and the head of the pharmacy department about the investigation into the practices of pharmacists in Nigeria and the widespread abuse of the drug J.C Okafor, he revealed that there are regulations governing the production of cough syrup with codeine, but its sale in every pharmacy must be monitored, lest it falls into the wrong hands, which would be disastrous.
Okafor said, 'We have a plan on how to reduce the availability of cough syrup that contains codeine in Nigeria, which is causing people to be unable to stop using it without a doctor's prescription.
Every home that observes that law, we respect it.
Many Nigerians are turning to Emzor painkillers for their substantial pain issues due to the drug shortage among regular users.
