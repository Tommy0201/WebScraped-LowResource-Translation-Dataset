He went on to say that the problem that arose in Benue was because the state government did not prepare the cattle before they began to graze.
At the meeting whose main topic is, 'Community Development: Security Challenges and the Need to Find Effective Ways to Address Them,' the conflict between farmers and herders arose during the administration of President Muhammdu Buhari.
Idris said: "In my opinion, to reduce the conflict between farmers and herders, state governments should strive to build cattle ranches in their states before they enact laws to restrict herding."

Commonwealth leaders are meeting to discuss whether the Prince of Wales will represent his mother as the head of the organization that connects 53 countries.
On Thursday, Queen Elizabeth of Britain decided that her son Charles would preside over an event called CHOGM at Buckingham Palace.
He said it was his wish for his son Charles to one day lead CHOGM.
But it is a position that Ezenwa's wife does not assign to her child unless he dies.
It is expected that the Commonwealth leaders will decide on who will lead them when they meet at Windsor Castle, but there is no indication that it will be announced at that meeting.
Is there no one else capable of leading the Commonwealth?
BBC reporter James Landale said that the weight has not been measured as the position is shifting among the leaders in the Commonwealth.
However, the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, has canceled his trip to the meeting taking place in London so that he can understand the reasons behind the attacks happening in his country.

Ebere Iwuji is a spokesperson for the governor regarding media issues told BBC Igbo on the phone that this fee is a one-time charge.
It was stated that money will be used to support various community projects that the people of Imo State are undertaking by themselves.
Despite the report saying that it will take six million naira to build one community, Nzewuji said there is no specific name for the fund, because those living in the community now should contribute to this.
Nzewuji said, "This money will not go into the Imo State government account; it is owned by the various local government areas that make up the Community Government Council (CGC)."
Nzewuji went on to say that the Imo state government will allocate ten million naira to support any town that applies for this funding, as they are looking to boost development in local industries and other needs of the community.
We believe that anyone who desires progress will want to support it, especially where they are actively involved in community development efforts, Nzewuji said.
Nzewuji has gone ahead to explain that no town chief has ever been exempted from paying tax for this matter.

The head of the parish council is Father Emmanuel Obimma, popularly known as 'Ebube Mmụọnsọ', and other clergymen, along with the women who were in attendance, gathered there to support the youths who had gone to worship God during their vigil on Friday night into early Saturday morning.

The report stated that this is not the first time the youths of the town are disturbing those attending the special Catholic church gathering that takes place every Friday night, attracting more than twenty people each week.
Those present when the incident occurred reported that the youths of the town are extorting money from drivers and also vandalizing some property.
At that time, they told Father Obimma something that made the elder's meeting gather to discuss the issues that had arisen with the youths, and they left it to the town's king and the elders to take action.

Ezeife: Igbo people will ask Buhari again.
Ezeife and some of his supporters have stated that urging Igbo people to support Buhari in order to gain positions in 2023 is a deceptive statement.
Chukwuemeka Ezeife is a elder among some Igbo people.
Chukwuemeka Ezeife, an Igbo man from Igbo-Ukwu who was formerly a governor in Anambra State, is a representative for the Igbo people in Nigeria.
Those with a stake in Igbo land have declared that the Igbo people will reject the support of President Buhari in the 2019 elections as they did in 2015.
They warned the Igbo people to know that if they support President Buhari to come back to power again in 2019 and that the position of president will reach the Igbo people, it is a promise made to a woman on top of a bed, because it is a matter of deceit.
In summary, some members of the APC including the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustafa, and the Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, urged the Igbo people to support Buhari in 2019 in order to reap the benefits in 2023.
Give the Igbo people a leader in 2019 - Balarabe Musa.
The Igbo people are being oppressed like those who have been defeated in war.
But some people with a voice in Igbo believe that the statement is a trick to gain votes from the Igbo, just as Buhari deceived the Igbo for their votes in 2015, and they did not support him in the 2019 elections.
In his discussion with Sun newspaper, the person who appointed the Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, said: 'We are yet to see how it will be done.'
I don't think we should be asking people for the position of president.
My belief is that if we go and ask God, who knows that if an Igbo person were to take the position of president, it would benefit the Fulani, benefit the Yoruba, and also benefit the various regions in Nigeria, because we would restructure Nigeria's economy for progress.
Talking about 2023 is not just a simple matter; anyone who talks about it is seeking to deceive the Igbo people.
Similarly, the former president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dozie Ikedife, stated that the Igbo are people whose promise to attain the presidency means nothing in the past.
He told the small media office Sun: 'The Igbo have been given many promises like this in the past, and have been disappointed by our people.'
If someone hits you twice or thrice, when they come the fourth time, you should consider retaliating.
The strength of the earth has not overcome a person.
Ikedife continued to say: 'What is important to me is how to follow the laws and dialogue to achieve Biafra without fighting or harming anyone.'
Remember in 2015, many Igbos did not vote for Buhari, which led to him receiving support from 95 percent and only five percent from those who voted for him, as many believed he had failed since taking office.

Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their arrest.
Ekweremadu 'hid his wealth'.
Peace has been placed in Nigeria's hands by Ekweremadu again.
The House of Representatives consists of 109 members, if 108 people are currently at Ekweremmadu's house, it means they are all at his place.
Remember that the Senate leadership decided today that security personnel should leave the residence of the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, immediately, where they were stationed today.
Ekweremadu was prevented from leaving his house this morning, which caused him not to attend the meeting of the House of Representatives held today, where 14 lawmakers defected from APC to PDP.
Uche Anichukwu is a spokesperson for Ekweremadu, told BBC Igbo that the EFCC prevented him from leaving his house in Abuja, and not the DSS as we previously wrote.
@MrBanksOmishore is the special assistant to Bukola Saraki, posted the letter from the EFCC sent to Ekweremadu this morning, on Twitter.
In the letter, the EFCC stated that they want to investigate Ekweremadu for conspiracy, abuse of his official position, and the transfer of money referred to in English as 'money laundering'.
As Saraki spoke in the legislature and started the 'plenary', he mentioned that Ekweremadu was not present and stated that efforts should be made to ensure that the government does not derail from its responsibilities.
Sam Anyanwu said that he was with Ekweremadu yesterday, but he does not have a document showing that the police are looking for him.
At the end of the 'plenary', the lawmakers decided that the security personnel should leave the residence of the outgoing Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, immediately, so that he can enjoy his full rights.
This morning, Saraki was among those who were prohibited from leaving his house.
On the other hand, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, praised those who left the APC today for their success.
He said this on his Twitter account @MBuhari:.
The EFCC blocked Ekweremadu's route in Abuja.

They instructed those who spoke and condemned the Catholic Church on the day of judgment.
The High Court has sentenced the accused and executed Father John Adeyi's death sentence through pronouncement.
The court has given an order to execute the criminals.
The High Court in Makurdi, Benue State has ruled that two people, Hartuna Idi and Suleiman Gina, who conspired with others to kill Father John Adeyi, should be executed for their actions.
Remember that the four kidnappers include Saidu Abdullahi and Aliyu Garba, who killed Fada Adeyi, the Vicar-General of the Catholic Church in Otukpo Diocese, Benue State, and dumped his body in a farm near Otukpo in 2016.
What I have passed on to the elders.
Mikel Obi's father has been released by the abductors.
But after the police killed them, they stated that they received the pastor's family one million naira and some (N1.7m) as the initial payment but they were caught off guard when they heard that the community was preparing to come and rescue him where they had killed him.
One of them claimed that he was the one who shot him, where two other people were sentenced to death today, Wednesday.
In the message the church family sent to Daily Post, they expressed satisfaction that, at last, the expected yearning has reached them.
But they lamented that the decision reminded them of the brutal murder of Adeyi, who was a scholar.
The senators have arrested Ekweremadu.
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their arrest.

Is there a spirit living in a child that makes them come into the world?
The Igbo cultural traditions speak about the importance of hard work in the past and its relevance today.
In ancient times, the Igbo believed that elders had the power to perform magic.
A newborn baby in any home brings great joy to everyone.
But there are some places in Igbo land where a newborn baby with a big head can cause trouble.
The people of this community, like Igbuzo (Ibusa) in Delta State, see children as special.
Who is the chief?
Some stories say that the baby born with a big head is because her mother prayed to a spirit in this land to give her a child.
Are you going to kill this type of bird that was killed long ago?
Did you know that the Igbo people worshipped deities in ancient times?
They believe that the crown on the head is a mark of the spirit that has chosen that child to recognize them.
They call the children 'Ezenwa'.
They have the belief that their head is their crown.
As they believe, a child who is well taken care of will succeed in life because their destiny is firmly established, they are very diligent, and they will grow up to be a great leader who brings about significant change during times of war.
But it is the main thing that follows the initial problems.
It is important to take care of your hair well.
The deity participated at dawn.
Many of these traditional healers believe that a child with a runny nose will suffer from a serious illness or die if a pus-filled boil enters its nostril.
It is a disgrace to touch someone's hair without permission.
Anyone who does this should give that child money quickly or else the money will be lost.
Only this ceremony will stop the child from suffering a serious illness.
Only the mother of that child can touch this child with the hand on her head.
The ceremony of traditional head shaving.
The story says that it is the native doctors who shape the head of the child.
Now, famous people in the pictures and also many people use their heads to dance.
That child will grow up to be a talking child.
His family will ask him what he wants to use to cut his hair.
Everything he wanted on that day they will give him.
Christ the King.
The entire Igbo land is a place where the faith of the members of the Christ Church is strongly proclaimed.
This has caused many Igbo cultures to change.
Now, many members of the Igbo community do not believe that evil spirits exist in every child that comes into the world.
But they are still taking the child to the church for the priests to pray for him.
Doctor Anthony Mgbolu told BBC Igbo that the main cause is something that comes from that family lineage.
The Igbo culture teaches about the importance of good leadership.
An expert in the study of Africa and languages at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, told BBC Igbo that in the past there was no consensus whatsoever regarding the founding fathers in Igbo land.
Nnabuihe firmly stated that if the Igbo in ancient times had convictions in their heads, they should name it.
In her words: 'Dada is the name given to her by the Yoruba.'
The Igbo people who are very proud do so because they have had a relationship with the Yoruba people.
But is it truly a bad thing?
Nnamdi Daniels is an actor.
Many of the people we interviewed said there is nothing wrong with being bald, but in reality, many still see bald-headed people as those who are engaging in evil.
Nnamdi Daniels is a man who told BBC Igbo that he closed his eyes because of their discussion and comments about his hair.
In his words: "I remember the time I traveled to Niger State University."
"The security officer started asking me questions that confused me about my hair. This brought me great embarrassment."
The government has seized over two million codeine cough syrups.
The minister of health has reported that over two hundred cases of cholera have been recorded and is also monitoring others.
Codeine medication.
Young people excessively consume codeine.
The federal government has announced that they have removed over two million codeine cough syrups from the market in Nigeria.
The Minister of Health, Okammụta Isaac Adewole, said this when his committee presented its findings on the challenges of Codeine.
He mentioned that this is to show that the government is determined in its goal to control codeine abuse in Nigeria.
Mmachi Codeine: The cough medicine has become expensive.
Nafdac has lifted the ban on Emzor and others.
Adewole said that his office and the agency responsible for food and drugs, called the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control in English, collaborated on this initiative.
Remember in May of this year, the BBC released an image showing the impact of codeine cough syrup trafficking in Nigeria.
It is now time for this image to appear as the government announced that they will regulate the sale of this cough syrup.
The government says they are still considering other independent drug options.

2019 Election: Some Igbo people want to run for the presidency.
What causes the Igbo people to often go to these churches?
What made the Igbo chase a person into the evil forest.
The evil forest is where the Igbo worship the land, but it is a torment as they torment those who fall into this forest.
My siblings.
Igbo worships different spirits.
Why do the Igbo refer to the bad forest as the bad forest?
Did you know that the bad bush has been in Igbo land until now?
What is a bad forest?
An expert in African studies and languages at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, explained to BBC Igbo that a spiritual forest is not a bad forest as many people currently refer to it.
As the Igbo say with belief, the spirit's forest is where they worship the god living on Earth.
This place is where they speak ill of everyone.
In Igbo land, God is the most important, but the spirit that follows Him is the Earth.
Nnabuihe explained that in Igbo land, it is believed that the Earth is the spirit that created everything in the world.
Is there a spirit living in a child that makes them come into the world?
Are you going to kill this type of bird that was killed long ago?
The earth is bad (the bad earth is destruction).
Igbo believe that the Earth sees everything, which means that there is no evil at all that you can hide from its sight.
The wilderness still exists in Igbo land until now.
The ground will completely bury this person.
See the disease of the land that is affecting those who caused it harm.
Leprosy.
The year is over.
Nzịza (Dropsy).
Hernia.
Nnabuihe explained at that time, there was no doctor who would attempt to treat the diseases we mentioned.
Anyone who had a certain disease should have reported the serious thing they did before they died.
If he does not repent of the evil he has done, they will cast him out into the wilderness.
Did you know that the Igbo people worshipped deities in ancient times?
Things you should not do around an Igbo person.
Other things like quarrelling over property or a spouse of someone else, or engaging in witchcraft and other diseases can cause the land to reject that person.
The fall of a person is not bad.
As Nnabụihe explained, this person's downfall is about abandoning their children and also their family.
The Catholic Church is the predominant faith in Igbo land.
The Igbo of old had a belief that whoever accepted a person who was rejected by their family was welcome to the land.
Where the spirit world exists in Igbo land now.

If what Babatunde Fashola said about electricity generation is true, it will be a major benefit for those in the power sector in Nigeria.
It is a sacrifice.
The Nigerian soldiers are complaining about the lack of light.
The Minister of Power, Works, and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, stated that the electric power being generated in Nigeria has reached seven thousand megawatts.
Fashola said this in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State yesterday.
The electricity will not shine brightly until the year 2023 - Electricity workers.
PHCN should give you three months' notice before they cut off the electricity - Ọkaiwu.
Fashola is in Calabar where the heads of departments he oversees are having a meeting.
He said that despite the work remaining unfinished, his department has set up a electricity grid in Nigeria more than it was when they started work in 2015.
Fashola is overseeing three ministries combined in the Buhari government.
Three years ago, the news was that power generation was a major problem we had in Nigeria.
Then, the fire makers say that they have nothing to offer the children of Nigeria.
At that time, we were generating 2,690 megawatts for the Nigerians, but the report has changed.
What we can have now is 5,222 megawatts, which is the highest since Nigeria emerged.
Now, what is being produced is 7000 megawatts, but it is also distributed 7000.
There are still challenges, but we will say that we are moving forward.

Many people often ask why women are married in some parts of Igbo land, this story explains it.

There are often stories about some young people who love themselves and agree to live together as husband and wife, but they do not observe the marriage customs as they should.

In Igbo land, it is believed that a man does not marry a woman unless he has made plans for her.

As an expert in cultural matters, Nze Olueze Ụkaejuoha (Duruagwụ the second) from Ụmụakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State told BBC Igbo that this law is very beneficial to their community and also has various penalties associated with it.

To show that it wasn't him who killed her, he will agree to marry the woman’s corpse.
He will come to marry her.
He will return to inform the ones who are my child and his wife that they have passed away.

Nigeria 2019 elections: The candidates contesting for the presidential seat – Muhammadu Buhari.
The President of Nigeria is Muhammadu Buhari, who is running for office for the second time under a party he founded.
President Muhammadu Buhari.
President Muhammadu Buhari is currently campaigning for votes to become the President of Nigeria for a third time.
It was in December 1983 (1984) that the military took power in Nigeria, but some people have attributed it to Buhari's influence in 1985.
The BBC broadcast is still ongoing now.
Buhari eventually became the president through the democratic election held in 2015, after making efforts to achieve that position for three consecutive terms.
As he governs like a ruler, Buhari has not provided any real answers regarding the rights of individuals.
Although he is in a position of authority and can express his opinion, many people are in prison because Buhari refuses to release them as the court has ordered.
This man is 76 years old and was elected in 2015, and he promised that he would fight against crime and corruption in the society, as well as promote the economy of Nigeria.
Four years are coming to an end, but many people still do not believe that what happened means what it appears to be.
He promised that he would defeat Boko Haram fighting in Nigeria against those seeking to carve out an Islamic state in northeastern Nigeria, but recently, these extremists have been undermining Buhari's agenda to remain in the presidency by how they attack that region.
Those who have their mouths in the conversation believe that Buhari will meet the demands of the party that is not in power, while their name resonates more - the one who is the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is also a follower from the north of Nigeria just like Buhari.
Buhari is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) known as a figure standing firm in the political landscape of Nigeria, although many people view his campaign as a sign of economic mismanagement.

Imo APC Primaries: Uche Nwosu has been announced as the candidate for the governorship position in Imo.
These people defeated the candidates of Imo in the front: Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP, Hope Uzodimma of the APC, and Ifeanyi Ararume of the APGA.
The BBC Igbo director, Adline Okere, said that only Ararume told her that he wouldn't come because he is starting to campaign for his vote.
It is the ceremony that started around half past two in the afternoon.
At that same meeting, Uche Nwosu promised that he would pay thirty thousand naira as a stipend at the end of the month if the federal government approves it.
Nwosu went ahead to say that his party has no one supporting the presidential candidate to contribute to the discussion about the support he gives to President Muhammadu Buhari.
Another thing he said was; 'There is nothing in my 'manifesto' that I will not do.'.
The seven words spoken by Uche Nwosu are:
Uche Nwosu joined the AA party from the APC to contest for the governorship position in Imo State.
Nwosu announced what he would do for the people of Imo State if he were to assume office in the election that would take place in March 2019.
Buhari for President: 'Otu AA can defeat Uche Nwosu'.

It was emphasized that 'it is only when a computer is used to count the votes that it will be said that what is in the server is accurate.'

Similarly, the BBC also asked the popular computer user, Emeka Unachukwu, what a 'server' is.
Unachukwu says that 'a Server is a computer that connects other computers together to store different types of data.'
He said that Inec can claim that they don't have a 'server' because there is another office where the data is kept, but it is not true that they don't have a 'server' where there is data.
He said that the Internet has its own 'server' where many people store their information.
Unachukwu says that "It cannot be said that they do not have a server because they have a place where they store information which is data."
They may call this a 'database,' but what it really is, is a server for the computer that connects with others that can store or send information to it.
She said that the new system is that they don't have a server.
They are calling on people to come and take their PVCs to be ready for the elections.
Unachukwu said that even if votes are counted and taken to where they are supposed to be recorded, Inec will still place it on its 'server'.

President Mohammadu Buhari stated that his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, did well in focusing on the education of children.

The women of Ozubulu under Ekwusigo in Anambra State went to the police station in Amawbia to report the assault.
They did this to vote among those who thought they were electing a representative in their community on August 6 of last year.
They say that these people are risking their lives and that is also why they are seeking shelters that will provide evidence against those who accused them in court.

Will this month end in Igbo land?
This shows that marriage is a cultural tradition that unites ethnic groups in Nigeria.
But if a woman reaches the age to marry and does not, especially in the southeastern region of Nigeria, she is looked at differently, and sometimes faces some challenges, especially regarding what they have accomplished in life.
What caused it?
As sociologists in the field of human relationships describe in English, the primary cause of the abuse or violence against unmarried women is culture and lack of proper understanding.
In his statement, Dr. Adedeji Oyenuga, who teaches 'Sociology' at Lagos State University, explained that it is a cultural issue and that some parents view the lack of marriage of their children as a sign that they have not raised their children well.
He said it is a tradition. There was a time when a child focused on his parents, but when the child grew up to become an adult, he focused on marrying a woman, and the woman focused on marrying a husband. If this does not happen, especially if she is a woman, her parents will take her as if they have invested a lot of effort in raising her.
Dr. Nkechi Emma-Echiegu is a lecturer at Ebonyi State University and also stated that it is a custom.
In Igbo land, it is customary to ask the mother before asking the person getting married.
He went on to say that it is a bad tradition to insult or harm a girl for being unmarried.
Listen to what he/she said in a loud voice.
What causes a husband to be unfaithful at a time?
Dr. Adedeji Oyenuga said that the reason for not marrying at the time was a woman who read a lot of books, which could make men seek her and play her music.
Another is that women outnumber men in number. It was also stated that men often leave the place where they were born to seek greener pastures more than women, which is why marrying someone from one's own home is more common.
What a single girl has not been able to achieve leads to marriage.
As the expert Oyenuga stated, a woman who does not have a husband faces many challenges such as excessive drinking, smoking, severe tiredness, and the type of stress that the British call 'depression', which can lead to extreme fatigue and numbness.
Echiegu said that it can lead to various disasters including excessive thinking, bad behavior, domestic violence, wastage, and suicide.
They said that having understanding will help to stop the bad tradition that regards an unmarried woman as someone without value.

Misty Spann said that her mother cursed her because she and 'the three wise men who advised her would not be involved in that agreement' were not in the same boat.
Patricia Ann Spann said that she believes their marriage is not against the law because her name is not on her daughter’s birth certificate as her mother, since they met each other two years before they got married.
Misty Spann admitted to violating the law against blood relationships. She was sentenced to ten years for investigation and visitation related to mental health issues.
Where her mother, Patricia, is going to serve an eight-year prison sentence, her name will also be added to the list as a person involved in the case if she is found guilty.

Igbo Food: What you don’t know about the edible fruit you are consuming.
Breadfruit is a food that is not used for playing around in Igbo land, and it is also one of the characteristics of the Igbo people.
Jackfruit.
The pawpaw is left to ripen before its fruit is harvested.
Many Igbo people know about black velvet tamarind, but they do not know how to cultivate it before it becomes something to eat.
The breadfruit tree produces large fruits that are called 'breadfruit' in English. Its fruits are green, while the seeds inside produce what we call breadfruit.
The ripe jackfruit fell from its tree, it was left to ferment before it was harvested and processed into the edible jackfruit. That is why the Igbo say, 'the jackfruit must fall when it is ripe.'
Before eating the breadfruit, it will go through different paths as follows:
His head is hot.
His/her eye is hurting.
Or maybe see him in the light.
The food to be cooked is ready.
Jackfruit.
Cooking oil.
Some also add spices, seasonings, and salt.
Some use fish traps while others use vegetable baskets.
Some also add corn kernels.
Some also put in pepper.
The breadfruit is ripe when the time comes.
How is it done?
These are the things you need to do before taking your bath.
Wash your hands thoroughly to ensure that there are no dirt or small stones in them.
Put it in a pot called 'pressure pot' and also add enough water to cover it well.
Some use soot or ashes to ensure it writes and burns quickly.
It should also be poured into water, add ground pepper, cooking oil, and salt.
Let it be that it is combined with the ingredients you put inside it.
Turn it around and leave it to stay in the fire for a while to cook well.
Breadfruit is a food that has its own flavor that you can enjoy whether you add any seasoning or not.
How to eat it.
In some places like Urualla in Imo State, they do not throw away the water used to cook their corn. They drink the water separately and eat their corn separately.
Some do not put cooking oil in their yam porridge, while others leave the yam porridge watery because they mixed it with water.
The fruit of the eghe tree is harvested, either by using a traditional tool or a modern tool today.
Many people use the fruit of the breadfruit tree to prepare yam porridge.
How to preserve pumpkins.
The fruit is harvested in the sun before it is put in a bag for those who will buy it to take to the market.
Before you boil the one that was called, soak it in water overnight until morning. This will help it to cook well and quickly when you are ready to cook it.
What it provides in the body.
Research by scientific experts has shown that pumpkin has many beneficial substances in the body, such as riboflavin, iron, niacin, thiamine, iron, and phosphorus. It also contains potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, calcium, zinc, manganese, selenium, as well as phosphorus and vitamin C.
It is good for the human soul. Some use its leaves to wash the hair because it kills the dandruff that the English call dandruff, and it also stops hair loss.
It also contains a small amount of fat known as saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium.
Some drink the sap of the oil melon while others eat it with its juice.
You do not know what else they use it for.
Palm oil is added to some dishes to give it flavor.

Codeine, a painkiller, is a report on how excessive consumption of cough medicine is ruining the lives of young people in Nigeria according to a BBC investigation.
Codeine, a dangerous substance, is reported to be causing the decline of the lives of young people in Nigeria today.
BBC journalists conducted an undercover investigation revealing how drug manufacturers and sellers are illegally selling drugs to children in Nigeria.
Codeine is not a toy: Emzor has not harmed anyone.
Emzor Pharmaceuticals has suspended one of its staff for the BBC report titled "Codeine Kills."
A boy is taking cough syrup, codeine.
The news says that politicians are giving young people drugs as gifts.
The pharmaceutical company in Nigeria, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, has fired one employee and suspended two others due to their involvement in the illegal sale of codeine cough syrup, according to a BBC investigation that revealed how the cough syrup has contributed to the deaths of Nigerian youths.
Emzor has informed their marketing team about the BBC reporter who covered the Emzolyn syrup.
They said this on social media after BBC released the footage they made on Monday evening, April 30.
In the footage that lasted about an hour, a group of drug sellers included a worker from Emzor who was seen administering medicines to the people.
Anger and disappointment filled those who came to see the movie that was shown in Lagos yesterday.
Someone said that politicians are the ones pouring fuel into the fire burning in Kano as he stated that they are using the homeless as a gift.
But Emzor Pharmaceuticals has stated that they do not sell drugs inappropriately.
They also said that they have stopped selling Emzolyn with Codeine until they finish the investigation into the charges of illegally selling their cough syrup.
Emzor stopped bringing their one bid and eventually withdrew it from consideration.
Emzor Pharmaceuticals is a reputable company that operates independently.
They have a license to sell drugs exceeding two hundred, which includes Emzolyn Codeine approved by NAFDAC.
They went on to say: "The distribution of Emzolyn Codeine should be halted until a complete investigation is conducted."
In a BBC interview with the head of the department responsible for the training and work of pharmacists in Nigeria's southeastern region, J.C. Okafor stated that there are regulations in place regarding the distribution of cough syrups containing codeine, and if any pharmacy is found distributing it improperly, it will be shut down.
Okafor said, "We have a plan on how to distribute cough medicine with codeine in Nigeria, which makes it so that a person cannot buy it without a doctor's prescription."
"Any office that violates that law, we close it."
Some Nigerians on social media are criticizing Emzor for their role in the severe drug abuse problem among young people.
One person questioned the organization, saying: "So, if the BBC does not showcase that investigation, will your organization do anything to stop the excessive use of this drug among the youth?"
Don't the workers know what they are doing?
Another person, Mairo Mandara, called for the government to ban the sale of cough medicine containing codeine.

Bioraj Pharmaceuticals has announced that they have terminated their employee, Junaid Hassan, for misconduct, while Emzor also stated that they have dismissed their employee, Chukwunonye Madubuike, for misconduct.
Both appeared in the BBC picture as people using their backs to sell codeine drugs.
But those who are speaking say that the government should punish these agencies more than the investigation being conducted on them.
