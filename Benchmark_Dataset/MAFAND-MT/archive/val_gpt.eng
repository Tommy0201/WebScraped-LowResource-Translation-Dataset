Will the Nigeria team make an appearance this month?
People are asking about the budget and expenditure report of Nigeria for the year 2018 and why it has not been released.
President Buhari.
Buhari's administration gave the lawmakers the 2018 budget proposal in November 2017.
When the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, presented the budget for the year 2018 to the National Assembly on the seventh day of November last year, people believed that it would be passed before the start of January 2018.
This month is May, which is the fifth month of 2018, but the lawmakers have not yet passed the budget.
Experts in economics explain that how it is currently managed will affect Nigeria, especially in terms of the progress of the country.
The top news this morning: The Senate has passed the bill.
Obiano has made an Igala person a commissioner.
The members of the committee have elected a new chairman.
The reason why this matter is so terrible is that it is unknown when the lawmakers will participate in the budget and hand it over to the president to make it a law.
The lawmakers said that the reason they did not present the '2018 budget' is due to various government agencies not providing details on how they intend to generate revenue and their expenses, despite the lawmakers having guidelines on how the different agencies should budget for 2018.
But the department responsible for planning, which is called the Ministry of National Planning in English, stated that everything the lawmakers need to prepare the budget is contained in the document provided to them.
Ben Akabueze, the head of the budget and planning department, said that everything the lawmakers requested is in the document that President Muhammadu Buhari gave to the lawmakers last November.
But he went ahead to say that the legislators are calling the heads of various departments to come and respond, which is what he is doing..
What it means.
Experts in urban development say that Nigeria will not properly manage urban resources unless this budget is implemented.
On social media like Twitter, people talk about what is happening.
The person behind the @AdeBanqie handle on Twitter stated that Nigerians should say that lawmakers will not fulfill their duties in a government led by someone who speaks their mind.
The organization is examining how the government used the budget structure that BudgIT wrote about, as it is the most significant since discussions on the budget began in Nigeria.
@OduObodumu is asking if there is another town that has recorded expenditures and revenues up to the end of this year.
@Purrples said that he is calling the chairman of the House of Representatives to come and respond to him regarding the budget and expenditures.
Another person who contributed to this conversation is @ApanpaOlasumbo, who is questioning why Nigerians don't speak out about what is happening.
As things are happening, the lawmakers say they will participate in the document on the 16th of this month, but that is not what they initially said, which is why we ask, 'will yam be able to escape it now?'.

The reason America is not issuing visas in Abuja now.
The Ghanaian authorities have given directives on how the Igbo people should conduct their trade in their communities.
He said that this problem started when the Ghanaian government brought a plan that Nigerians and foreigners should have what the English call 'equity' amounting to millions of dollars.
The person who proposed this plan is the minister in charge of commerce.
Obiora said that although the plan is not new, because the government that took over the administration intends to implement it, it is still uncertain now how uncertain it was then.
Export customers often obtain their equipment from foreign countries.
Despite the fact that the market will open tomorrow, Obiora said that it is the negotiation between the Nigerian government and Ghana that led them to turn off the power.
But also say that they came from another way.
The agents of the devil are tormenting Nigeria.
Review of those without equity that will start tomorrow.
One person said that this matter will affect Nwafor Akajiofor, who is a trader at Magazine Market.
Akajiofor said that the term 'resident permit and equity' is a strategy the Ghanaian government is using to expel Nigerians from Ghana.
He said that the document that grants permission to live in Ghana, called a 'resident permit', is not easy to obtain.
The resident permit costs 200,000, but getting it is not easy.
Obiora himself said that what is generating confusion is the law established in Ghana that foreigners cannot trade in the market.
Those who have the necessary documents will not engage in street trading; they will only have markets on the designated streets, as this law stipulates.
As he said, if the Ghanaians continue to follow this law, many citizens in the country will suffer because they will not benefit from what is in it.

The incident involving the judges referred to as the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers pertains to how a Nigerian woman wants to use speed to access the rights of women and their families.
The immigration and refugee board (IRB) of Canada stated that the woman was not eligible for a visa because she should have fled to a safer area in Nigeria such as Ibadan or Port Harcourt.
The IRB appeal board decided that this case is a matter that should be taken into account when deciding other cases concerning individuals from Nigeria seeking asylum.
The IRB officials have now issued this type of decision against the people of China, India, and Pakistan.
Members of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers believe that this law will make it harder for Nigerians seeking asylum to survive than it was before.

The person at the head of the meeting of the governors of the southeastern region is David Umahi, who also governs Ebonyi State, stated this while addressing reporters about what this meeting means.
Umahi said that it is important to improve the place where products are received at the airport.
The Enugu airport is in close proximity to the airport of the foreign airline, but it lacks many necessities, such as its runway lights, which would allow planes to land at night.
In the 2018 budget, five hundred million naira was allocated for this airport project.
Remember that the actions of Ike Ekweremadu, who is the deputy senate president of Nigeria and other senators from the southeast, contributed to the charge against President Muhammadu Buhari regarding how senators embezzled funds meant for projects like the second Niger bridge, Enugu airport, the Benin-Ore road, and many other works that would benefit Nigerians, diverting the funds elsewhere.
In his statement, Ekweremadu said that his thoughts and those of the lawmakers from southeastern Nigeria are aligned with the efforts of the Enugu State government to run various projects.
Ekweremadu said that it was in the legislative department called 'committee' in English that this investigation took place, and noted that the committee members asked the public certain questions about what happened and how it unfolded.

A person working in the courtroom said: 'He speaks to the judge before he falls.'
"Take him to the hospital where he died."
Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has become the Chairperson of the African Union.
Morsi is the first person to gain power as an elected official.
He stayed in office for a year before the soldiers ousted him in 2013 when the country descended into chaos.
Morsi has been in prison since he was convicted for the deaths of those killed during the protests that led to his removal from office.
The Egyptian government used force to suppress supporters of Morsi and the group known as 'Muslim Brotherhood', from which he came to power.
This case against Morsi before his death relates to accusations of his involvement in the escape of Hamas members from Palestine in Egypt.
Who is Morsi?
Morsi was born in the town of El-Adwah in the Nile Delta region of Sharqiya in 1951.
He studied Arts and Humanities at Cairo University before he would go to America to study further.
A Muslim Brotherhood group selected him again as their candidate for president in 2012, as they forced out the one they wanted to replace.
If it succeeds, he promises that he will rule all the Egyptians.
Many people who did not wait for him say that he has not fulfilled his promise within the one year he ruled Egypt.
The people returned to say that it happened one year ago on June 30, 2013.
On the evening of July 3, the military issued a decree dissolving the government of Egypt and stated that they no longer had a government.
Morsi said that this is not true.

They enacted a law to shut it down, which led to the closure of many markets in Nigeria in 2008.

A man does not pound yam at his kin's place, nor would he pound yam where those who displease him are, unless they give him permission to do so.
It is also a law that a woman does not break kola nut in Igbo land.
The kola nut and the women.
In Igbo land, a woman does not climb the oji (bitter kola) tree, she does not understand the oji in her own tree.
A woman does not joke with her food.
A woman does not climb on the black (thing) but a woman sells black (thing).
A woman is not allowed to dip her hands into the bowl of kolanuts if the men are present and have not been served.
Some continue to use their hands to give the woman the bitter leaf so that she won't have the opportunity to put her hands in the plate that was used to prepare the bitter leaf.

See the poor eating with the rich.
Some foods that were originally known as the food of the poor have now been adopted by the wealthy due to health concerns.
In Nigeria, about thirty or forty years ago, some foods were seen as foods that were hard to come by.
Many of these foods are ones that people grow themselves on their farms or buy cheaply in the market because there are not many people looking for them.
But now, these foods are actually what the rich enjoy due to the increase in diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and obesity which are considered 'rich people's diseases'.
In the survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008, 11.2 percent of Nigerians out of 169 million had hypertension, while 2.7 percent had diabetes.
The diseases caused many people to return to the food they previously disregarded, which is why these foods are now very expensive and beyond the reach of the poor.
See 10 of those foods.
Fish is cold.
Fish is often regarded as food for the poor.
More than thirty years ago, the use of the 'fridge' to cook food was seen in the homes of the poor, students, or when a person had no money in their pocket, whereas beef or chicken was for the wealthy.
A man living in Lagos, named Kingsley Udofa, described this point by saying: 'There was a time in our land, Nigeria, when frozen fish was meant for the poor.'
At that time, the fish from the refrigerator was given various bad names to mock it, such as 'Fish corpse' in Igbo; 'Lagos corpse' in Yoruba; 'Dead fish, sowing eyes' in Ibibio which means 'he died and gave birth to eyes.'
People are farming and eating live fish.
Now, the music has stopped.
A fridge fish is unseen and unprepared for many people, especially the rich, as the fish is excessively priced in the market.

As the Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri stated, Nigerians consume about 3.2 million metric tons of fish annually, out of which more than eighty percent is imported.
A metric ton of ten thousand is equivalent to thirty-three thousand four hundred thirty-four containers.
Yam.
The yam is very expensive.
It is millet porridge whether it is millet pudding or cake, porridge is food for the poor, food those without beans use to fill their stomachs because they have no money to buy beans.
But now, the food is not ripe because the ants are eating it.
The town devoid of a health center, where many are afflicted by diseases like diabetes and hypertension, and those seeking to visit the hospital often face hardship, which makes it difficult for them to access proper treatment akin to the struggles of trying to buy commodities in a marketplace.
3. Kanda.
The cowhide that the Yoruba refer to as 'kpọmọ' was once the item that the poor used to make do during times when they did not have money to buy cow or chicken meat.
As things are going nowadays, the rich have taken it and made it a special dish, where it is cooked in a unique way like edikang ikong or cooked with pepper and served with palm wine.
In 2014, when the government, represented by the former Minister of Agriculture, Akinwumi Adesina, stated that they wanted to regulate the activities of people involved in fishing, it caused a lot of anger among the people and led the government to scrap the plan altogether.
As experts have explained, kanda has no fat or harmful oils referred to as cholesterol in English, like beef, which they said in excess can lead to serious diseases such as heart disease and hypertension.
Ojoko.
Some call it plantain, some call it banana, others call it the indigenous variety, while many call it une or unere.
The poor use the oil that is seen in fire to cook, but now, the rich have made a big feast.
Oats is a good food that nourishes the body because it contains fiber and other minerals that support life, such as magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium.
As health experts describe, the palm tree produces sap when it is tapped.
Ejula.
Ejula is a good food that provides nutrients to the body, but it is very difficult to find now.
But when there is no meat, no fish, the poor person goes to the bush to gather vegetables to prepare food.
The rich do not suffer from the scarcity of food in the beginning because, as the Igbo say, there is hardship in completing the harvest.
But now, using palm oil for cooking has become a mark of wealth due to its high price.
Eggplant is a good food that contains protein, calcium, selenium, magnesium, and provides blood.
Garri.
Garri is a food that is eaten by both the poor and the rich.
Eating it, especially when it is watered down, is something that is taken as food by people in the world, or when money is dropped in your pocket first.
If you ask the students at their school, they will tell you how to use palm oil, fresh fish, or bush meat to prepare their meal.
Now is the time for business.
The rich and the poor are all under the same umbrella called 'painter' and earn more than five hundred naira (N500).
The cancer specialist at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr. Remi Ajekigbe, stated that the reason many Nigerians are currently suffering from cancer is that they do not eat our local foods like cassava, which contains fiber, and instead consume foreign foods.
Character.
Vegetables are good food that nourishes the body.
Behavior is another food associated with the poor, but many rich people also consume it.
Behavior provides protein and also gives blood.
Nutrition experts say that the best source of protein is plant-based because it has no harmful fats known as cholesterol.
Breadfruit.
The breadfruit is a special delicacy that the strong support.
Breadfruit was initially overlooked by young people due to its painful preparation, but now, it is enjoyed by those with money.
Breadfruit provides protein, blood, potassium, and other nutrients that nourish the body.
Eat water.
The yam has fiber.
Yam is a food that people do not often eat at first because it does not taste like yam.
Only the poor responded to it with hunger.
But now, many people are accusing the rich of consuming it.
Those with diabetes are eating it.
Researchers report that yam has fiber, low sodium, and high potassium, which is why it is said to be good for people with diabetes.
Remember that 'fiber' aids the process of digestion, excessive 'sodium' can cause high blood pressure, while 'potassium' helps to lower blood pressure, thus reducing the likelihood of kidney stones.
Isha.
Isha is charging a high price that some poor people cannot afford.
Those who do not have money used to cook meals when they had no money for meat or fish, but now, cooking is also for those with money because of the high cost of prices.
What makes people beg the poor.
As a nutritionist and wellness expert, Dr. Florence Uchendu explains why many people are currently eating fast food more than they used to, particularly due to diseases prevalent in Nigeria today such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and cancer.
The disease that is prevalent in Nigeria is a disease that is not commonly seen in our foreign countries.

Masquerade is a distinctive feature of the Igbo people.
The king who rules Nri, Chief Emelie Okika, has warned the people of Aguleri and Igboukwu to stop attacking the leader of all Ndigbo.
Okika said firmly that Nri is the place where the Ndigbo originated, but also stated that the issue of Ndigbo's source of water is a spiritual matter that should not be used for political maneuvering.
He went to Aguleri in Igboukwu to encourage their efforts in documenting the history of the Igbo land, but tell them to remove their hands from the matter so that the wrath of the gods does not descend on them.
The benefits of traditional medicine are significant in Igbo culture.

The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Mathew Kukah, has stated that a crisis may occur in Nigeria as the 2019 general elections approach.

How about the one billion dollars the government allocated for community security?
When Bishop Kukah was interviewed by the BBC, we asked him about the billions of naira the government allocated for national security.
Bishop Kukah responded that the most important thing is not to do the usual things but to provide direction for governance that will enable politicians to live well, as this will not benefit those they are supposed to serve.
He said that before peace comes to Nigeria, bloodshed will completely cease.
Bishop Kukah responded to the question by saying: 'Money cannot buy peace..'
Listen to what was said in the evening in English.
It is not a lack of money that caused the absence of peace in Nigeria, but rather the abundance of money in this country that led to it.
Do not invest a little money in meaningless political campaigns.
It is putting in a lot of effort that is not a waste, especially in a country where everything is about money like Nigeria.
The government has invested a lot of money in water, we have no water.
They have put in a lot of money for electricity, we have no power.
What will bring peace in Nigeria is not guns and violence.
He went on to say that what politicians are doing is to be able to make another direction and not to do anything that would benefit the people.
Bishop Kukah said that the government's job is to ensure that those in power have trust and motivation.
But many Nigerians do not have it.
Such a situation undermines the government and its citizens are caught in it.

What happened that made me pour oil on the heads of people - Okorocha.
The APC has told Okorocha to stop accusing their leaders.
Pati is saying that Okorocha should follow the procedures stipulated by the APC laws to demonstrate his grievances regarding the issue affecting him.
Owele Rochas Okorocha.
Okorocha is accusing the APC chairman of electoral misconduct in Imo.
The political party in power is the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Owelle Rochas Okorocha is being accused by the leaders of that party of wrongdoing.
Okorocha stated that the chairman of the APC, John Odigie-Oyegun, has not adhered to the court order regarding the election to select those who will lead their party and the person who will contest for them in Imo.
In Bolaji Abdullahi's article, it was stated that the APC described Okorocha's allegations against them as baseless and asserted that they did not receive any documents from the court regarding the suspension of the election.
Okorocha did not attend the APC leaders' meeting.
Is Okorocha eligible to email his achievements to the Governor of Imo State?
APC office fire: It was PDP that did this - Onwuemeodo.
Abdullahi said, 'In answering the allegations against Imo led by Oyegun that 'the Supreme Court's decision is not true.'
For this reason, we are telling Governor Imo to stop this kind of accusation because they are not true.
"In conducting this election that involves the whole of Nigeria, you should examine them one by one as well as guide those who will lead the parties in different states, those responsible for it are the National Working Committee (NWC) following the procedures and party laws," the statement said.
The APC went ahead to advise Okorocha to follow their legal procedures to address any issues or grievances against him.
Remember that Okorocha and some APC members in Imo State have issues with how the primaries were conducted to select those who will lead the party in Imo, as well as the support he is giving his brother to become the leader of Imo if he wins.
See what the group called 'Restoration Group' said about the election under Okorocha after they concluded their meeting in Abuja last month.
Nigeria will borrow public funds to meet the 2018 budget.
The agency in charge of public wealth in Nigeria has announced that they will sell assets worth 400 billion naira for the 2018 budget.
The light bulb is bright.
The electric power sector is among those that will be privatized.
Nigeria is looking to reach 400 billion naira in public revenue that will help fund the 2019 budget, the head of the public finance department has said.
Alex Okoh, the head of the department called 'Bureau of Public Enterprises' in English, stated that the government has outlined a strategy for selling government assets, which they used to raise funds from the international financial institutions.
The money they brought will be used to improve the electricity distribution network, which they claim is not functioning well.
The Federal Government has spent N500 billion to boost the budget.
Enugu State has allocated 103 billion naira for 2018.
Will the 2018 budget help the new generation?
In an interview with Reuters last week, he told them that the Nigerian government has plans to sell or give private companies something like power generation and electricity distribution.
Reuters reports that the government has informed them that it wants to acquire some public rice from the government-owned Nigerian Reinsurance Company in November of this year.
In 2013, Nigeria began to sell its electricity assets with the hope that it would help to make power more available than it used to be and attract foreign investment, but none of those things happened.
Okoh stated that the electricity department in the 37 public sectors has not benefitted from the necessary profits, but he did not disclose how much wealth the government sold.
He went ahead to state that Nigeria has accumulated up to 7.8 billion dollars from foreign countries through revenue generation.

Umerue said that 'The British refer to this as 'Gender Issues''.
But Mbonu-Ezeoke did not agree with this statement. He said, 'Whenever you watch the Super Falcons play, the generations of players are impressive!'
This shows that this game is liked by many people.
Stephen Mbonu agreed that what Mbonu-Ezeoke said is true, but he urged caution, saying: 'the time has come to discover many women who can play football very well.'

These groups are; elders, clan members and children, the same generation, titled men and others, and masquerades.

Look at the clothes that the Igbo people wear for the masquerade.
What the Igbo people do.
The elders and others - The elders and others are the most respected in the community, they are the final arbiters of issues.
They are the ones who discuss all matters concerning the community.
They are the ones who use tradition and the community's customs to ensure that fair judgments are made and to see that everyone’s rights are respected.
Before a person is accepted into this community, they must be a wise person shaped by their experiences and the things they have seen.
That is why he uses songs of warriors who have fought in battles before, conquered in war, and sometimes brings back the heads of enemies.
They are given special respect in Igbo land where people from one community to another wear eagle feathers on their caps to show that they are the ones valued in the society because the eagle is the most beautiful bird in Igbo land.
The white cloth they wear shows those who are pure in heart, character, and righteous judgment.
Their celebration caps show that through their suffering and blood shed in the war, their people continue to move forward.
It was made with two peace offerings; the chief and others.
The elders are superior to others in status.
Brothers - These are the young men from different families in the community.
They are the ones making decisions about various issues in the community regarding development and the welfare of the people.
It is the relatives who are consulted whenever someone commits a wrongdoing; they are the ones who go to the elders to find out what the elders say about the community or about their family.
All families have their relatives here to start any disputes regarding issues such as land, domestic matters, inheritance rights, and crimes such as murder, theft, adultery, or beating one's spouse.
Any decision they make lasts in all communities.
Siblings are seen as representatives from different families.
Umuada - This group is a group of women in the community, where women gather together to discuss the future of their families and issues concerning their husbands and children.
The people of the community are called to adjudicate in times of conflicts between towns, and whatever they decide is final and not subject to dispute.
The daughters are also the ones who mediate peace among their brothers and their wives to ensure there is uniformity or harmony in the family.
The daughters include female children born into the family as well as married women in the family.
A generation - This is a place where those of the same generation, like the boys born at the same time, are found.
They are the ones responsible for the security of the entire community.
They are also the ones who go to war or fight whenever a battle arises.
They are the ones that clear the way, rain and market, whether there is something blocking it or the rain has flooded the path.
They also produce anything that brothers or chiefs and others provide under the law as long as there is someone to be expelled from the community or someone to be punished.
They will strive to ensure that the person can enter the town and shake hands.
The masquerade - a masquerade is one that only welcomes those who have passed their acceptance.
They are working with the police to ensure there is order in the community.
Whenever there is a disagreement like in a land case, the masquerade will strike the ground to indicate that no one should be allowed to enter that land until a decision has been made regarding it.
The masquerade also has a time to appear to entertain the community by dancing.
The weather is different now than it was then.
The elders and others, like the leaders of the community, are the last to hear the matter, and it is any issue that does not allow for debate among siblings and children that is brought to them.
They are the ones who talk nonsense.
The siblings and children are like representatives in the community.
The elders make laws regarding the community where different family members live in the town.
