Will the Nigeria team make an appearance this month?
People are asking about the budget and expenditure report of Nigeria for the year 2018 and why it has not been released.
President Buhari.
Buhari's administration gave the lawmakers the 2018 budget proposal in November 2017.
When the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, presented the budget for the year 2018 to the National Assembly on the seventh day of November last year, people believed that it would be passed before the start of January 2018.
This month is May, which is the fifth month of 2018, but the lawmakers have not yet passed the budget.
Experts in economics explain that how it is currently managed will affect Nigeria, especially in terms of the progress of the country.
The top news this morning: The Senate has passed the bill.
Obiano has made an Igala person a commissioner.
The members of the committee have elected a new chairman.
The reason why this matter is so terrible is that it is unknown when the lawmakers will participate in the budget and hand it over to the president to make it a law.
The lawmakers said that the reason they did not present the '2018 budget' is due to various government agencies not providing details on how they intend to generate revenue and their expenses, despite the lawmakers having guidelines on how the different agencies should budget for 2018.
But the department responsible for planning, which is called the Ministry of National Planning in English, stated that everything the lawmakers need to prepare the budget is contained in the document provided to them.
Ben Akabueze, the head of the budget and planning department, said that everything the lawmakers requested is in the document that President Muhammadu Buhari gave to the lawmakers last November.
But he went ahead to say that the legislators are calling the heads of various departments to come and respond, which is what he is doing..
What it means.
Experts in urban development say that Nigeria will not properly manage urban resources unless this budget is implemented.
On social media like Twitter, people talk about what is happening.
The person behind the @AdeBanqie handle on Twitter stated that Nigerians should say that lawmakers will not fulfill their duties in a government led by someone who speaks their mind.
The organization is examining how the government used the budget structure that BudgIT wrote about, as it is the most significant since discussions on the budget began in Nigeria.
@OduObodumu is asking if there is another town that has recorded expenditures and revenues up to the end of this year.
@Purrples said that he is calling the chairman of the House of Representatives to come and respond to him regarding the budget and expenditures.
Another person who contributed to this conversation is @ApanpaOlasumbo, who is questioning why Nigerians don't speak out about what is happening.
As things are happening, the lawmakers say they will participate in the document on the 16th of this month, but that is not what they initially said, which is why we ask, 'will yam be able to escape it now?'.

The reason America is not issuing visas in Abuja now.
The Ghanaian authorities have given directives on how the Igbo people should conduct their trade in their communities.
He said that this problem started when the Ghanaian government brought a plan that Nigerians and foreigners should have what the English call 'equity' amounting to millions of dollars.
The person who proposed this plan is the minister in charge of commerce.
Obiora said that although the plan is not new, because the government that took over the administration intends to implement it, it is still uncertain now how uncertain it was then.
Export customers often obtain their equipment from foreign countries.
Despite the fact that the market will open tomorrow, Obiora said that it is the negotiation between the Nigerian government and Ghana that led them to turn off the power.
But also say that they came from another way.
The agents of the devil are tormenting Nigeria.
Review of those without equity that will start tomorrow.
One person said that this matter will affect Nwafor Akajiofor, who is a trader at Magazine Market.
Akajiofor said that the term 'resident permit and equity' is a strategy the Ghanaian government is using to expel Nigerians from Ghana.
He said that the document that grants permission to live in Ghana, called a 'resident permit', is not easy to obtain.
The resident permit costs 200,000, but getting it is not easy.
Obiora himself said that what is generating confusion is the law established in Ghana that foreigners cannot trade in the market.
Those who have the necessary documents will not engage in street trading; they will only have markets on the designated streets, as this law stipulates.
As he said, if the Ghanaians continue to follow this law, many citizens in the country will suffer because they will not benefit from what is in it.

The incident involving the judges referred to as the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers pertains to how a Nigerian woman wants to use speed to access the rights of women and their families.
The immigration and refugee board (IRB) of Canada stated that the woman was not eligible for a visa because she should have fled to a safer area in Nigeria such as Ibadan or Port Harcourt.
The IRB appeal board decided that this case is a matter that should be taken into account when deciding other cases concerning individuals from Nigeria seeking asylum.
The IRB officials have now issued this type of decision against the people of China, India, and Pakistan.
Members of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers believe that this law will make it harder for Nigerians seeking asylum to survive than it was before.

The person at the head of the meeting of the governors of the southeastern region is David Umahi, who also governs Ebonyi State, stated this while addressing reporters about what this meeting means.
Umahi said that it is important to improve the place where products are received at the airport.
The Enugu airport is in close proximity to the airport of the foreign airline, but it lacks many necessities, such as its runway lights, which would allow planes to land at night.
In the 2018 budget, five hundred million naira was allocated for this airport project.
Remember that the actions of Ike Ekweremadu, who is the deputy senate president of Nigeria and other senators from the southeast, contributed to the charge against President Muhammadu Buhari regarding how senators embezzled funds meant for projects like the second Niger bridge, Enugu airport, the Benin-Ore road, and many other works that would benefit Nigerians, diverting the funds elsewhere.
In his statement, Ekweremadu said that his thoughts and those of the lawmakers from southeastern Nigeria are aligned with the efforts of the Enugu State government to run various projects.
Ekweremadu said that it was in the legislative department called 'committee' in English that this investigation took place, and noted that the committee members asked the public certain questions about what happened and how it unfolded.

A person working in the courtroom said: 'He speaks to the judge before he falls.'
"Take him to the hospital where he died."
Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has become the Chairperson of the African Union.
Morsi is the first person to gain power as an elected official.
He stayed in office for a year before the soldiers ousted him in 2013 when the country descended into chaos.
Morsi has been in prison since he was convicted for the deaths of those killed during the protests that led to his removal from office.
The Egyptian government used force to suppress supporters of Morsi and the group known as 'Muslim Brotherhood', from which he came to power.
This case against Morsi before his death relates to accusations of his involvement in the escape of Hamas members from Palestine in Egypt.
Who is Morsi?
Morsi was born in the town of El-Adwah in the Nile Delta region of Sharqiya in 1951.
He studied Arts and Humanities at Cairo University before he would go to America to study further.
A Muslim Brotherhood group selected him again as their candidate for president in 2012, as they forced out the one they wanted to replace.
If it succeeds, he promises that he will rule all the Egyptians.
Many people who did not wait for him say that he has not fulfilled his promise within the one year he ruled Egypt.
The people returned to say that it happened one year ago on June 30, 2013.
On the evening of July 3, the military issued a decree dissolving the government of Egypt and stated that they no longer had a government.
Morsi said that this is not true.

They enacted a law to shut it down, which led to the closure of many markets in Nigeria in 2008.

A man does not pound yam at his kin's place, nor would he pound yam where those who displease him are, unless they give him permission to do so.
It is also a law that a woman does not break kola nut in Igbo land.
The kola nut and the women.
In Igbo land, a woman does not climb the oji (bitter kola) tree, she does not understand the oji in her own tree.
A woman does not joke with her food.
A woman does not climb on the black (thing) but a woman sells black (thing).
A woman is not allowed to dip her hands into the bowl of kolanuts if the men are present and have not been served.
Some continue to use their hands to give the woman the bitter leaf so that she won't have the opportunity to put her hands in the plate that was used to prepare the bitter leaf.

See the poor eating with the rich.
Some foods that were originally known as the food of the poor have now been adopted by the wealthy due to health concerns.
In Nigeria, about thirty or forty years ago, some foods were seen as foods that were hard to come by.
Many of these foods are ones that people grow themselves on their farms or buy cheaply in the market because there are not many people looking for them.
But now, these foods are actually what the rich enjoy due to the increase in diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and obesity which are considered 'rich people's diseases'.
In the survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008, 11.2 percent of Nigerians out of 169 million had hypertension, while 2.7 percent had diabetes.
The diseases caused many people to return to the food they previously disregarded, which is why these foods are now very expensive and beyond the reach of the poor.
See 10 of those foods.
Fish is cold.
Fish is often regarded as food for the poor.
More than thirty years ago, the use of the 'fridge' to cook food was seen in the homes of the poor, students, or when a person had no money in their pocket, whereas beef or chicken was for the wealthy.
A man living in Lagos, named Kingsley Udofa, described this point by saying: 'There was a time in our land, Nigeria, when frozen fish was meant for the poor.'
At that time, the fish from the refrigerator was given various bad names to mock it, such as 'Fish corpse' in Igbo; 'Lagos corpse' in Yoruba; 'Dead fish, sowing eyes' in Ibibio which means 'he died and gave birth to eyes.'
People are farming and eating live fish.
Now, the music has stopped.
A fridge fish is unseen and unprepared for many people, especially the rich, as the fish is excessively priced in the market.

As the Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri stated, Nigerians consume about 3.2 million metric tons of fish annually, out of which more than eighty percent is imported.
A metric ton of ten thousand is equivalent to thirty-three thousand four hundred thirty-four containers.
Yam.
The yam is very expensive.
It is millet porridge whether it is millet pudding or cake, porridge is food for the poor, food those without beans use to fill their stomachs because they have no money to buy beans.
But now, the food is not ripe because the ants are eating it.
The town devoid of a health center, where many are afflicted by diseases like diabetes and hypertension, and those seeking to visit the hospital often face hardship, which makes it difficult for them to access proper treatment akin to the struggles of trying to buy commodities in a marketplace.
3. Kanda.
The cowhide that the Yoruba refer to as 'kpọmọ' was once the item that the poor used to make do during times when they did not have money to buy cow or chicken meat.
As things are going nowadays, the rich have taken it and made it a special dish, where it is cooked in a unique way like edikang ikong or cooked with pepper and served with palm wine.
In 2014, when the government, represented by the former Minister of Agriculture, Akinwumi Adesina, stated that they wanted to regulate the activities of people involved in fishing, it caused a lot of anger among the people and led the government to scrap the plan altogether.
As experts have explained, kanda has no fat or harmful oils referred to as cholesterol in English, like beef, which they said in excess can lead to serious diseases such as heart disease and hypertension.
Ojoko.
Some call it plantain, some call it banana, others call it the indigenous variety, while many call it une or unere.
The poor use the oil that is seen in fire to cook, but now, the rich have made a big feast.
Oats is a good food that nourishes the body because it contains fiber and other minerals that support life, such as magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium.
As health experts describe, the palm tree produces sap when it is tapped.
Ejula.
Ejula is a good food that provides nutrients to the body, but it is very difficult to find now.
But when there is no meat, no fish, the poor person goes to the bush to gather vegetables to prepare food.
The rich do not suffer from the scarcity of food in the beginning because, as the Igbo say, there is hardship in completing the harvest.
But now, using palm oil for cooking has become a mark of wealth due to its high price.
Eggplant is a good food that contains protein, calcium, selenium, magnesium, and provides blood.
Garri.
Garri is a food that is eaten by both the poor and the rich.
Eating it, especially when it is watered down, is something that is taken as food by people in the world, or when money is dropped in your pocket first.
If you ask the students at their school, they will tell you how to use palm oil, fresh fish, or bush meat to prepare their meal.
Now is the time for business.
The rich and the poor are all under the same umbrella called 'painter' and earn more than five hundred naira (N500).
The cancer specialist at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Dr. Remi Ajekigbe, stated that the reason many Nigerians are currently suffering from cancer is that they do not eat our local foods like cassava, which contains fiber, and instead consume foreign foods.
Character.
Vegetables are good food that nourishes the body.
Behavior is another food associated with the poor, but many rich people also consume it.
Behavior provides protein and also gives blood.
Nutrition experts say that the best source of protein is plant-based because it has no harmful fats known as cholesterol.
Breadfruit.
The breadfruit is a special delicacy that the strong support.
Breadfruit was initially overlooked by young people due to its painful preparation, but now, it is enjoyed by those with money.
Breadfruit provides protein, blood, potassium, and other nutrients that nourish the body.
Eat water.
The yam has fiber.
Yam is a food that people do not often eat at first because it does not taste like yam.
Only the poor responded to it with hunger.
But now, many people are accusing the rich of consuming it.
Those with diabetes are eating it.
Researchers report that yam has fiber, low sodium, and high potassium, which is why it is said to be good for people with diabetes.
Remember that 'fiber' aids the process of digestion, excessive 'sodium' can cause high blood pressure, while 'potassium' helps to lower blood pressure, thus reducing the likelihood of kidney stones.
Isha.
Isha is charging a high price that some poor people cannot afford.
Those who do not have money used to cook meals when they had no money for meat or fish, but now, cooking is also for those with money because of the high cost of prices.
What makes people beg the poor.
As a nutritionist and wellness expert, Dr. Florence Uchendu explains why many people are currently eating fast food more than they used to, particularly due to diseases prevalent in Nigeria today such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and cancer.
The disease that is prevalent in Nigeria is a disease that is not commonly seen in our foreign countries.

Masquerade is a distinctive feature of the Igbo people.
The king who rules Nri, Chief Emelie Okika, has warned the people of Aguleri and Igboukwu to stop attacking the leader of all Ndigbo.
Okika said firmly that Nri is the place where the Ndigbo originated, but also stated that the issue of Ndigbo's source of water is a spiritual matter that should not be used for political maneuvering.
He went to Aguleri in Igboukwu to encourage their efforts in documenting the history of the Igbo land, but tell them to remove their hands from the matter so that the wrath of the gods does not descend on them.
The benefits of traditional medicine are significant in Igbo culture.

The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Mathew Kukah, has stated that a crisis may occur in Nigeria as the 2019 general elections approach.

How about the one billion dollars the government allocated for community security?
When Bishop Kukah was interviewed by the BBC, we asked him about the billions of naira the government allocated for national security.
Bishop Kukah responded that the most important thing is not to do the usual things but to provide direction for governance that will enable politicians to live well, as this will not benefit those they are supposed to serve.
He said that before peace comes to Nigeria, bloodshed will completely cease.
Bishop Kukah responded to the question by saying: 'Money cannot buy peace..'
Listen to what was said in the evening in English.
It is not a lack of money that caused the absence of peace in Nigeria, but rather the abundance of money in this country that led to it.
Do not invest a little money in meaningless political campaigns.
It is putting in a lot of effort that is not a waste, especially in a country where everything is about money like Nigeria.
The government has invested a lot of money in water, we have no water.
They have put in a lot of money for electricity, we have no power.
What will bring peace in Nigeria is not guns and violence.
He went on to say that what politicians are doing is to be able to make another direction and not to do anything that would benefit the people.
Bishop Kukah said that the government's job is to ensure that those in power have trust and motivation.
But many Nigerians do not have it.
Such a situation undermines the government and its citizens are caught in it.

What happened that made me pour oil on the heads of people - Okorocha.
The APC has told Okorocha to stop accusing their leaders.
Pati is saying that Okorocha should follow the procedures stipulated by the APC laws to demonstrate his grievances regarding the issue affecting him.
Owele Rochas Okorocha.
Okorocha is accusing the APC chairman of electoral misconduct in Imo.
The political party in power is the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Owelle Rochas Okorocha is being accused by the leaders of that party of wrongdoing.
Okorocha stated that the chairman of the APC, John Odigie-Oyegun, has not adhered to the court order regarding the election to select those who will lead their party and the person who will contest for them in Imo.
In Bolaji Abdullahi's article, it was stated that the APC described Okorocha's allegations against them as baseless and asserted that they did not receive any documents from the court regarding the suspension of the election.
Okorocha did not attend the APC leaders' meeting.
Is Okorocha eligible to email his achievements to the Governor of Imo State?
APC office fire: It was PDP that did this - Onwuemeodo.
Abdullahi said, 'In answering the allegations against Imo led by Oyegun that 'the Supreme Court's decision is not true.'
For this reason, we are telling Governor Imo to stop this kind of accusation because they are not true.
"In conducting this election that involves the whole of Nigeria, you should examine them one by one as well as guide those who will lead the parties in different states, those responsible for it are the National Working Committee (NWC) following the procedures and party laws," the statement said.
The APC went ahead to advise Okorocha to follow their legal procedures to address any issues or grievances against him.
Remember that Okorocha and some APC members in Imo State have issues with how the primaries were conducted to select those who will lead the party in Imo, as well as the support he is giving his brother to become the leader of Imo if he wins.
See what the group called 'Restoration Group' said about the election under Okorocha after they concluded their meeting in Abuja last month.
Nigeria will borrow public funds to meet the 2018 budget.
The agency in charge of public wealth in Nigeria has announced that they will sell assets worth 400 billion naira for the 2018 budget.
The light bulb is bright.
The electric power sector is among those that will be privatized.
Nigeria is looking to reach 400 billion naira in public revenue that will help fund the 2019 budget, the head of the public finance department has said.
Alex Okoh, the head of the department called 'Bureau of Public Enterprises' in English, stated that the government has outlined a strategy for selling government assets, which they used to raise funds from the international financial institutions.
The money they brought will be used to improve the electricity distribution network, which they claim is not functioning well.
The Federal Government has spent N500 billion to boost the budget.
Enugu State has allocated 103 billion naira for 2018.
Will the 2018 budget help the new generation?
In an interview with Reuters last week, he told them that the Nigerian government has plans to sell or give private companies something like power generation and electricity distribution.
Reuters reports that the government has informed them that it wants to acquire some public rice from the government-owned Nigerian Reinsurance Company in November of this year.
In 2013, Nigeria began to sell its electricity assets with the hope that it would help to make power more available than it used to be and attract foreign investment, but none of those things happened.
Okoh stated that the electricity department in the 37 public sectors has not benefitted from the necessary profits, but he did not disclose how much wealth the government sold.
He went ahead to state that Nigeria has accumulated up to 7.8 billion dollars from foreign countries through revenue generation.

Umerue said that 'The British refer to this as 'Gender Issues''.
But Mbonu-Ezeoke did not agree with this statement. He said, 'Whenever you watch the Super Falcons play, the generations of players are impressive!'
This shows that this game is liked by many people.
Stephen Mbonu agreed that what Mbonu-Ezeoke said is true, but he urged caution, saying: 'the time has come to discover many women who can play football very well.'

The Igbo people have their own way of governing themselves before the white people came to start ruling with kings and different forms of administration.

But this does not mean that the Igbo did not have a system of governance that worked well for them in the past.

These groups are; elders, clan members and children, the same generation, titled men and others, and masquerades.
Our people told me that if I don’t return to the house, I won’t see my husband.

Look at the clothes that the Igbo people wear for the masquerade.
What the Igbo people do.
The elders and others - The elders and others are the most respected in the community, they are the final arbiters of issues.
They are the ones who discuss all matters concerning the community.
They are the ones who use tradition and the community's customs to ensure that fair judgments are made and to see that everyone’s rights are respected.
Before a person is accepted into this community, they must be a wise person shaped by their experiences and the things they have seen.
That is why he uses songs of warriors who have fought in battles before, conquered in war, and sometimes brings back the heads of enemies.
They are given special respect in Igbo land where people from one community to another wear eagle feathers on their caps to show that they are the ones valued in the society because the eagle is the most beautiful bird in Igbo land.
The white cloth they wear shows those who are pure in heart, character, and righteous judgment.
Their celebration caps show that through their suffering and blood shed in the war, their people continue to move forward.
It was made with two peace offerings; the chief and others.
The elders are superior to others in status.
Brothers - These are the young men from different families in the community.
They are the ones making decisions about various issues in the community regarding development and the welfare of the people.
It is the relatives who are consulted whenever someone commits a wrongdoing; they are the ones who go to the elders to find out what the elders say about the community or about their family.
All families have their relatives here to start any disputes regarding issues such as land, domestic matters, inheritance rights, and crimes such as murder, theft, adultery, or beating one's spouse.
Any decision they make lasts in all communities.
Siblings are seen as representatives from different families.
Umuada - This group is a group of women in the community, where women gather together to discuss the future of their families and issues concerning their husbands and children.
The people of the community are called to adjudicate in times of conflicts between towns, and whatever they decide is final and not subject to dispute.
The daughters are also the ones who mediate peace among their brothers and their wives to ensure there is uniformity or harmony in the family.
The daughters include female children born into the family as well as married women in the family.
A generation - This is a place where those of the same generation, like the boys born at the same time, are found.
They are the ones responsible for the security of the entire community.
They are also the ones who go to war or fight whenever a battle arises.
They are the ones that clear the way, rain and market, whether there is something blocking it or the rain has flooded the path.
They also produce anything that brothers or chiefs and others provide under the law as long as there is someone to be expelled from the community or someone to be punished.
They will strive to ensure that the person can enter the town and shake hands.
The masquerade - a masquerade is one that only welcomes those who have passed their acceptance.
They are working with the police to ensure there is order in the community.
Whenever there is a disagreement like in a land case, the masquerade will strike the ground to indicate that no one should be allowed to enter that land until a decision has been made regarding it.
The masquerade also has a time to appear to entertain the community by dancing.
The weather is different now than it was then.
The elders and others, like the leaders of the community, are the last to hear the matter, and it is any issue that does not allow for debate among siblings and children that is brought to them.
They are the ones who talk nonsense.
The siblings and children are like representatives in the community.
The elders make laws regarding the community where different family members live in the town.
One generation like the soldiers of the land, protects the community and ensures that all towns live in peace.
He is going to war or organizing things in a town that does not suit him.

The Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has stated that the state should serve as a pathway to providing training for cattle before they are prepared for grazing.
The police chief said this yesterday in Kaduna at a meeting with community security stakeholders, stating that he would help mediate the conflict between farmers and herders.
He went on to say that the problem that arose in Benue was because the state government did not prepare the cattle before they began to graze.
At the meeting whose main topic is, 'Community Development: Security Challenges and the Need to Find Effective Ways to Address Them,' the conflict between farmers and herders arose during the administration of President Muhammdu Buhari.
Idris said: "In my opinion, to reduce the conflict between farmers and herders, state governments should strive to build cattle ranches in their states before they enact laws to restrict herding."

Other African countries envy Nigeria for its movies.

Oscars 2018: In the heart of Africa and Nigeria.

Commonwealth leaders are meeting to discuss whether the Prince of Wales will represent his mother as the head of the organization that connects 53 countries.
On Thursday, Queen Elizabeth of Britain decided that her son Charles would preside over an event called CHOGM at Buckingham Palace.
He said it was his wish for his son Charles to one day lead CHOGM.
But it is a position that Ezenwa's wife does not assign to her child unless he dies.
It is expected that the Commonwealth leaders will decide on who will lead them when they meet at Windsor Castle, but there is no indication that it will be announced at that meeting.
Is there no one else capable of leading the Commonwealth?
BBC reporter James Landale said that the weight has not been measured as the position is shifting among the leaders in the Commonwealth.
However, the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, has canceled his trip to the meeting taking place in London so that he can understand the reasons behind the attacks happening in his country.

Ebere Iwuji is a spokesperson for the governor regarding media issues told BBC Igbo on the phone that this fee is a one-time charge.
It was stated that money will be used to support various community projects that the people of Imo State are undertaking by themselves.
Despite the report saying that it will take six million naira to build one community, Nzewuji said there is no specific name for the fund, because those living in the community now should contribute to this.
Nzewuji said, "This money will not go into the Imo State government account; it is owned by the various local government areas that make up the Community Government Council (CGC)."
Nzewuji went on to say that the Imo state government will allocate ten million naira to support any town that applies for this funding, as they are looking to boost development in local industries and other needs of the community.
We believe that anyone who desires progress will want to support it, especially where they are actively involved in community development efforts, Nzewuji said.
Nzewuji has gone ahead to explain that no town chief has ever been exempted from paying tax for this matter.

The head of the parish council is Father Emmanuel Obimma, popularly known as 'Ebube Mmụọnsọ', and other clergymen, along with the women who were in attendance, gathered there to support the youths who had gone to worship God during their vigil on Friday night into early Saturday morning.

The report stated that this is not the first time the youths of the town are disturbing those attending the special Catholic church gathering that takes place every Friday night, attracting more than twenty people each week.
Those present when the incident occurred reported that the youths of the town are extorting money from drivers and also vandalizing some property.
At that time, they told Father Obimma something that made the elder's meeting gather to discuss the issues that had arisen with the youths, and they left it to the town's king and the elders to take action.
The youths often confront the drivers who are driving people during that church service.

Ezeife: Igbo people will ask Buhari again.
Ezeife and some of his supporters have stated that urging Igbo people to support Buhari in order to gain positions in 2023 is a deceptive statement.
Chukwuemeka Ezeife is a elder among some Igbo people.
Chukwuemeka Ezeife, an Igbo man from Igbo-Ukwu who was formerly a governor in Anambra State, is a representative for the Igbo people in Nigeria.
Those with a stake in Igbo land have declared that the Igbo people will reject the support of President Buhari in the 2019 elections as they did in 2015.
They warned the Igbo people to know that if they support President Buhari to come back to power again in 2019 and that the position of president will reach the Igbo people, it is a promise made to a woman on top of a bed, because it is a matter of deceit.
In summary, some members of the APC including the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustafa, and the Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, urged the Igbo people to support Buhari in 2019 in order to reap the benefits in 2023.
Give the Igbo people a leader in 2019 - Balarabe Musa.
The Igbo people are being oppressed like those who have been defeated in war.
But some people with a voice in Igbo believe that the statement is a trick to gain votes from the Igbo, just as Buhari deceived the Igbo for their votes in 2015, and they did not support him in the 2019 elections.
In his discussion with Sun newspaper, the person who appointed the Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, said: 'We are yet to see how it will be done.'
I don't think we should be asking people for the position of president.
My belief is that if we go and ask God, who knows that if an Igbo person were to take the position of president, it would benefit the Fulani, benefit the Yoruba, and also benefit the various regions in Nigeria, because we would restructure Nigeria's economy for progress.
Talking about 2023 is not just a simple matter; anyone who talks about it is seeking to deceive the Igbo people.
Similarly, the former president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dozie Ikedife, stated that the Igbo are people whose promise to attain the presidency means nothing in the past.
He told the small media office Sun: 'The Igbo have been given many promises like this in the past, and have been disappointed by our people.'
If someone hits you twice or thrice, when they come the fourth time, you should consider retaliating.
The strength of the earth has not overcome a person.
Ikedife continued to say: 'What is important to me is how to follow the laws and dialogue to achieve Biafra without fighting or harming anyone.'
Remember in 2015, many Igbos did not vote for Buhari, which led to him receiving support from 95 percent and only five percent from those who voted for him, as many believed he had failed since taking office.

Ikeogu received a prize of 100 thousand dollars as the overall winner of the 'Nigerian Prize for Literature' for his book titled “The Heresiad.”

It is reducing the burden of the community's wealth.
Utomi said that 'if people are getting foreign exchange money at the black market to send their children abroad for education, it will make everyone want to send their children abroad, and the schools in our town will languish.'
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their arrest.
Ekweremadu 'hid his wealth'.
Peace has been placed in Nigeria's hands by Ekweremadu again.
The House of Representatives consists of 109 members, if 108 people are currently at Ekweremmadu's house, it means they are all at his place.
Remember that the Senate leadership decided today that security personnel should leave the residence of the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, immediately, where they were stationed today.
Ekweremadu was prevented from leaving his house this morning, which caused him not to attend the meeting of the House of Representatives held today, where 14 lawmakers defected from APC to PDP.
Uche Anichukwu is a spokesperson for Ekweremadu, told BBC Igbo that the EFCC prevented him from leaving his house in Abuja, and not the DSS as we previously wrote.
@MrBanksOmishore is the special assistant to Bukola Saraki, posted the letter from the EFCC sent to Ekweremadu this morning, on Twitter.
In the letter, the EFCC stated that they want to investigate Ekweremadu for conspiracy, abuse of his official position, and the transfer of money referred to in English as 'money laundering'.
As Saraki spoke in the legislature and started the 'plenary', he mentioned that Ekweremadu was not present and stated that efforts should be made to ensure that the government does not derail from its responsibilities.
Sam Anyanwu said that he was with Ekweremadu yesterday, but he does not have a document showing that the police are looking for him.
At the end of the 'plenary', the lawmakers decided that the security personnel should leave the residence of the outgoing Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, immediately, so that he can enjoy his full rights.
This morning, Saraki was among those who were prohibited from leaving his house.
On the other hand, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, praised those who left the APC today for their success.
He said this on his Twitter account @MBuhari:.
The EFCC blocked Ekweremadu's route in Abuja.
The image shows the place where EFCC arrested in front of Ekweremadu's house.
They instructed those who spoke and condemned the Catholic Church on the day of judgment.
The High Court has sentenced the accused and executed Father John Adeyi's death sentence through pronouncement.
The court has given an order to execute the criminals.
The High Court in Makurdi, Benue State has ruled that two people, Hartuna Idi and Suleiman Gina, who conspired with others to kill Father John Adeyi, should be executed for their actions.
Remember that the four kidnappers include Saidu Abdullahi and Aliyu Garba, who killed Fada Adeyi, the Vicar-General of the Catholic Church in Otukpo Diocese, Benue State, and dumped his body in a farm near Otukpo in 2016.
What I have passed on to the elders.
Mikel Obi's father has been released by the abductors.
But after the police killed them, they stated that they received the pastor's family one million naira and some (N1.7m) as the initial payment but they were caught off guard when they heard that the community was preparing to come and rescue him where they had killed him.
One of them claimed that he was the one who shot him, where two other people were sentenced to death today, Wednesday.
In the message the church family sent to Daily Post, they expressed satisfaction that, at last, the expected yearning has reached them.
But they lamented that the decision reminded them of the brutal murder of Adeyi, who was a scholar.
The senators have arrested Ekweremadu.
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their arrest.
APC is paying for their oppressive governance - Expert.
Is there a spirit living in a child that makes them come into the world?
The Igbo cultural traditions speak about the importance of hard work in the past and its relevance today.
In ancient times, the Igbo believed that elders had the power to perform magic.
A newborn baby in any home brings great joy to everyone.
But there are some places in Igbo land where a newborn baby with a big head can cause trouble.
The people of this community, like Igbuzo (Ibusa) in Delta State, see children as special.
Who is the chief?
Some stories say that the baby born with a big head is because her mother prayed to a spirit in this land to give her a child.
Are you going to kill this type of bird that was killed long ago?
Did you know that the Igbo people worshipped deities in ancient times?
They believe that the crown on the head is a mark of the spirit that has chosen that child to recognize them.
They call the children 'Ezenwa'.
They have the belief that their head is their crown.
As they believe, a child who is well taken care of will succeed in life because their destiny is firmly established, they are very diligent, and they will grow up to be a great leader who brings about significant change during times of war.
But it is the main thing that follows the initial problems.
It is important to take care of your hair well.
The deity participated at dawn.
Many of these traditional healers believe that a child with a runny nose will suffer from a serious illness or die if a pus-filled boil enters its nostril.
It is a disgrace to touch someone's hair without permission.
Anyone who does this should give that child money quickly or else the money will be lost.
Only this ceremony will stop the child from suffering a serious illness.
Only the mother of that child can touch this child with the hand on her head.
The ceremony of traditional head shaving.
The story says that it is the native doctors who shape the head of the child.
Now, famous people in the pictures and also many people use their heads to dance.
That child will grow up to be a talking child.
His family will ask him what he wants to use to cut his hair.
Everything he wanted on that day they will give him.
Christ the King.
The entire Igbo land is a place where the faith of the members of the Christ Church is strongly proclaimed.
This has caused many Igbo cultures to change.
Now, many members of the Igbo community do not believe that evil spirits exist in every child that comes into the world.
But they are still taking the child to the church for the priests to pray for him.
Doctor Anthony Mgbolu told BBC Igbo that the main cause is something that comes from that family lineage.
The Igbo culture teaches about the importance of good leadership.
An expert in the study of Africa and languages at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, told BBC Igbo that in the past there was no consensus whatsoever regarding the founding fathers in Igbo land.
Nnabuihe firmly stated that if the Igbo in ancient times had convictions in their heads, they should name it.
In her words: 'Dada is the name given to her by the Yoruba.'
The Igbo people who are very proud do so because they have had a relationship with the Yoruba people.
But is it truly a bad thing?
Nnamdi Daniels is an actor.
Many of the people we interviewed said there is nothing wrong with being bald, but in reality, many still see bald-headed people as those who are engaging in evil.
Nnamdi Daniels is a man who told BBC Igbo that he closed his eyes because of their discussion and comments about his hair.
In his words: "I remember the time I traveled to Niger State University."
"The security officer started asking me questions that confused me about my hair. This brought me great embarrassment."
The government has seized over two million codeine cough syrups.
The minister of health has reported that over two hundred cases of cholera have been recorded and is also monitoring others.
Codeine medication.
Young people excessively consume codeine.
The federal government has announced that they have removed over two million codeine cough syrups from the market in Nigeria.
The Minister of Health, Okammụta Isaac Adewole, said this when his committee presented its findings on the challenges of Codeine.
He mentioned that this is to show that the government is determined in its goal to control codeine abuse in Nigeria.
Mmachi Codeine: The cough medicine has become expensive.
Nafdac has lifted the ban on Emzor and others.
Adewole said that his office and the agency responsible for food and drugs, called the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control in English, collaborated on this initiative.
Remember in May of this year, the BBC released an image showing the impact of codeine cough syrup trafficking in Nigeria.
It is now time for this image to appear as the government announced that they will regulate the sale of this cough syrup.
The government says they are still considering other independent drug options.

2019 Election: Some Igbo people want to run for the presidency.
What causes the Igbo people to often go to these churches?
What made the Igbo chase a person into the evil forest.
The evil forest is where the Igbo worship the land, but it is a torment as they torment those who fall into this forest.
My siblings.
Igbo worships different spirits.
Why do the Igbo refer to the bad forest as the bad forest?
Did you know that the bad bush has been in Igbo land until now?
What is a bad forest?
An expert in African studies and languages at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe, explained to BBC Igbo that a spiritual forest is not a bad forest as many people currently refer to it.
As the Igbo say with belief, the spirit's forest is where they worship the god living on Earth.
This place is where they speak ill of everyone.
In Igbo land, God is the most important, but the spirit that follows Him is the Earth.
Nnabuihe explained that in Igbo land, it is believed that the Earth is the spirit that created everything in the world.
Is there a spirit living in a child that makes them come into the world?
Are you going to kill this type of bird that was killed long ago?
The earth is bad (the bad earth is destruction).
Igbo believe that the Earth sees everything, which means that there is no evil at all that you can hide from its sight.
The wilderness still exists in Igbo land until now.
The ground will completely bury this person.
See the disease of the land that is affecting those who caused it harm.
Leprosy.
The year is over.
Nzịza (Dropsy).
Hernia.
Nnabuihe explained at that time, there was no doctor who would attempt to treat the diseases we mentioned.
Anyone who had a certain disease should have reported the serious thing they did before they died.
If he does not repent of the evil he has done, they will cast him out into the wilderness.
Did you know that the Igbo people worshipped deities in ancient times?
Things you should not do around an Igbo person.
Other things like quarrelling over property or a spouse of someone else, or engaging in witchcraft and other diseases can cause the land to reject that person.
The fall of a person is not bad.
As Nnabụihe explained, this person's downfall is about abandoning their children and also their family.
The Catholic Church is the predominant faith in Igbo land.
The Igbo of old had a belief that whoever accepted a person who was rejected by their family was welcome to the land.
Where the spirit world exists in Igbo land now.
The importance of Mbaise in Imo State.
Fire outbreak in Okija.

Babatunde Fashola said that Nigeria needs to improve its infrastructure for electricity.
If what Babatunde Fashola said about electricity generation is true, it will be a major benefit for those in the power sector in Nigeria.
It is a sacrifice.
The Nigerian soldiers are complaining about the lack of light.
The Minister of Power, Works, and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, stated that the electric power being generated in Nigeria has reached seven thousand megawatts.
Fashola said this in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State yesterday.
The electricity will not shine brightly until the year 2023 - Electricity workers.
PHCN should give you three months' notice before they cut off the electricity - Ọkaiwu.
Fashola is in Calabar where the heads of departments he oversees are having a meeting.
He said that despite the work remaining unfinished, his department has set up a electricity grid in Nigeria more than it was when they started work in 2015.
Fashola is overseeing three ministries combined in the Buhari government.
Three years ago, the news was that power generation was a major problem we had in Nigeria.
Then, the fire makers say that they have nothing to offer the children of Nigeria.
At that time, we were generating 2,690 megawatts for the Nigerians, but the report has changed.
What we can have now is 5,222 megawatts, which is the highest since Nigeria emerged.
Now, what is being produced is 7000 megawatts, but it is also distributed 7000.
There are still challenges, but we will say that we are moving forward.

Many people often ask why women are married in some parts of Igbo land, this story explains it.

There are often stories about some young people who love themselves and agree to live together as husband and wife, but they do not observe the marriage customs as they should.

In Igbo land, it is believed that a man does not marry a woman unless he has made plans for her.

As an expert in cultural matters, Nze Olueze Ụkaejuoha (Duruagwụ the second) from Ụmụakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State told BBC Igbo that this law is very beneficial to their community and also has various penalties associated with it.

But in Akokwa town in Imo State, this plan does not sell at all, where families that give birth to daughters come to carry the corpse of their child and go bury it in their home.

To show that it wasn't him who killed her, he will agree to marry the woman’s corpse.
He will come to marry her.
He will return to inform the ones who are my child and his wife that they have passed away.

Nigeria 2019 elections: The candidates contesting for the presidential seat – Muhammadu Buhari.
The President of Nigeria is Muhammadu Buhari, who is running for office for the second time under a party he founded.
President Muhammadu Buhari.
President Muhammadu Buhari is currently campaigning for votes to become the President of Nigeria for a third time.
It was in December 1983 (1984) that the military took power in Nigeria, but some people have attributed it to Buhari's influence in 1985.
The BBC broadcast is still ongoing now.
Buhari eventually became the president through the democratic election held in 2015, after making efforts to achieve that position for three consecutive terms.
As he governs like a ruler, Buhari has not provided any real answers regarding the rights of individuals.
Although he is in a position of authority and can express his opinion, many people are in prison because Buhari refuses to release them as the court has ordered.
This man is 76 years old and was elected in 2015, and he promised that he would fight against crime and corruption in the society, as well as promote the economy of Nigeria.
Four years are coming to an end, but many people still do not believe that what happened means what it appears to be.
He promised that he would defeat Boko Haram fighting in Nigeria against those seeking to carve out an Islamic state in northeastern Nigeria, but recently, these extremists have been undermining Buhari's agenda to remain in the presidency by how they attack that region.
Those who have their mouths in the conversation believe that Buhari will meet the demands of the party that is not in power, while their name resonates more - the one who is the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is also a follower from the north of Nigeria just like Buhari.
Buhari is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) known as a figure standing firm in the political landscape of Nigeria, although many people view his campaign as a sign of economic mismanagement.

Imo APC Primaries: Uche Nwosu has been announced as the candidate for the governorship position in Imo.
These people defeated the candidates of Imo in the front: Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP, Hope Uzodimma of the APC, and Ifeanyi Ararume of the APGA.
The BBC Igbo director, Adline Okere, said that only Ararume told her that he wouldn't come because he is starting to campaign for his vote.
It is the ceremony that started around half past two in the afternoon.
At that same meeting, Uche Nwosu promised that he would pay thirty thousand naira as a stipend at the end of the month if the federal government approves it.
Nwosu went ahead to say that his party has no one supporting the presidential candidate to contribute to the discussion about the support he gives to President Muhammadu Buhari.
Another thing he said was; 'There is nothing in my 'manifesto' that I will not do.'.
The seven words spoken by Uche Nwosu are:
Uche Nwosu joined the AA party from the APC to contest for the governorship position in Imo State.
Nwosu announced what he would do for the people of Imo State if he were to assume office in the election that would take place in March 2019.
Buhari for President: 'Otu AA can defeat Uche Nwosu'.

It was emphasized that 'it is only when a computer is used to count the votes that it will be said that what is in the server is accurate.'

Similarly, the BBC also asked the popular computer user, Emeka Unachukwu, what a 'server' is.
Unachukwu says that 'a Server is a computer that connects other computers together to store different types of data.'
He said that Inec can claim that they don't have a 'server' because there is another office where the data is kept, but it is not true that they don't have a 'server' where there is data.
He said that the Internet has its own 'server' where many people store their information.
Unachukwu says that "It cannot be said that they do not have a server because they have a place where they store information which is data."
They may call this a 'database,' but what it really is, is a server for the computer that connects with others that can store or send information to it.
She said that the new system is that they don't have a server.
They are calling on people to come and take their PVCs to be ready for the elections.
Unachukwu said that even if votes are counted and taken to where they are supposed to be recorded, Inec will still place it on its 'server'.

President Mohammadu Buhari stated that his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, did well in focusing on the education of children.

The women of Ozubulu under Ekwusigo in Anambra State went to the police station in Amawbia to report the assault.
They did this to vote among those who thought they were electing a representative in their community on August 6 of last year.
They say that these people are risking their lives and that is also why they are seeking shelters that will provide evidence against those who accused them in court.

Will this month end in Igbo land?
This shows that marriage is a cultural tradition that unites ethnic groups in Nigeria.
But if a woman reaches the age to marry and does not, especially in the southeastern region of Nigeria, she is looked at differently, and sometimes faces some challenges, especially regarding what they have accomplished in life.
What caused it?
As sociologists in the field of human relationships describe in English, the primary cause of the abuse or violence against unmarried women is culture and lack of proper understanding.
In his statement, Dr. Adedeji Oyenuga, who teaches 'Sociology' at Lagos State University, explained that it is a cultural issue and that some parents view the lack of marriage of their children as a sign that they have not raised their children well.
He said it is a tradition. There was a time when a child focused on his parents, but when the child grew up to become an adult, he focused on marrying a woman, and the woman focused on marrying a husband. If this does not happen, especially if she is a woman, her parents will take her as if they have invested a lot of effort in raising her.
Dr. Nkechi Emma-Echiegu is a lecturer at Ebonyi State University and also stated that it is a custom.
In Igbo land, it is customary to ask the mother before asking the person getting married.
He went on to say that it is a bad tradition to insult or harm a girl for being unmarried.
Listen to what he/she said in a loud voice.
What causes a husband to be unfaithful at a time?
Dr. Adedeji Oyenuga said that the reason for not marrying at the time was a woman who read a lot of books, which could make men seek her and play her music.
Another is that women outnumber men in number. It was also stated that men often leave the place where they were born to seek greener pastures more than women, which is why marrying someone from one's own home is more common.
What a single girl has not been able to achieve leads to marriage.
As the expert Oyenuga stated, a woman who does not have a husband faces many challenges such as excessive drinking, smoking, severe tiredness, and the type of stress that the British call 'depression', which can lead to extreme fatigue and numbness.
Echiegu said that it can lead to various disasters including excessive thinking, bad behavior, domestic violence, wastage, and suicide.
They said that having understanding will help to stop the bad tradition that regards an unmarried woman as someone without value.

Misty Spann said that her mother cursed her because she and 'the three wise men who advised her would not be involved in that agreement' were not in the same boat.
Patricia Ann Spann said that she believes their marriage is not against the law because her name is not on her daughter’s birth certificate as her mother, since they met each other two years before they got married.
Misty Spann admitted to violating the law against blood relationships. She was sentenced to ten years for investigation and visitation related to mental health issues.
Where her mother, Patricia, is going to serve an eight-year prison sentence, her name will also be added to the list as a person involved in the case if she is found guilty.

Igbo Food: What you don’t know about the edible fruit you are consuming.
Breadfruit is a food that is not used for playing around in Igbo land, and it is also one of the characteristics of the Igbo people.
Jackfruit.
The pawpaw is left to ripen before its fruit is harvested.
Many Igbo people know about black velvet tamarind, but they do not know how to cultivate it before it becomes something to eat.
The breadfruit tree produces large fruits that are called 'breadfruit' in English. Its fruits are green, while the seeds inside produce what we call breadfruit.
The ripe jackfruit fell from its tree, it was left to ferment before it was harvested and processed into the edible jackfruit. That is why the Igbo say, 'the jackfruit must fall when it is ripe.'
Before eating the breadfruit, it will go through different paths as follows:
His head is hot.
His/her eye is hurting.
Or maybe see him in the light.
The food to be cooked is ready.
Jackfruit.
Cooking oil.
Some also add spices, seasonings, and salt.
Some use fish traps while others use vegetable baskets.
Some also add corn kernels.
Some also put in pepper.
The breadfruit is ripe when the time comes.
How is it done?
These are the things you need to do before taking your bath.
Wash your hands thoroughly to ensure that there are no dirt or small stones in them.
Put it in a pot called 'pressure pot' and also add enough water to cover it well.
Some use soot or ashes to ensure it writes and burns quickly.
It should also be poured into water, add ground pepper, cooking oil, and salt.
Let it be that it is combined with the ingredients you put inside it.
Turn it around and leave it to stay in the fire for a while to cook well.
Breadfruit is a food that has its own flavor that you can enjoy whether you add any seasoning or not.
How to eat it.
In some places like Urualla in Imo State, they do not throw away the water used to cook their corn. They drink the water separately and eat their corn separately.
Some do not put cooking oil in their yam porridge, while others leave the yam porridge watery because they mixed it with water.
The fruit of the eghe tree is harvested, either by using a traditional tool or a modern tool today.
Many people use the fruit of the breadfruit tree to prepare yam porridge.
How to preserve pumpkins.
The fruit is harvested in the sun before it is put in a bag for those who will buy it to take to the market.
Before you boil the one that was called, soak it in water overnight until morning. This will help it to cook well and quickly when you are ready to cook it.
What it provides in the body.
Research by scientific experts has shown that pumpkin has many beneficial substances in the body, such as riboflavin, iron, niacin, thiamine, iron, and phosphorus. It also contains potassium, copper, iron, magnesium, calcium, zinc, manganese, selenium, as well as phosphorus and vitamin C.
It is good for the human soul. Some use its leaves to wash the hair because it kills the dandruff that the English call dandruff, and it also stops hair loss.
It also contains a small amount of fat known as saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium.
Some drink the sap of the oil melon while others eat it with its juice.
You do not know what else they use it for.
Palm oil is added to some dishes to give it flavor.

Codeine, a painkiller, is a report on how excessive consumption of cough medicine is ruining the lives of young people in Nigeria according to a BBC investigation.
Codeine, a dangerous substance, is reported to be causing the decline of the lives of young people in Nigeria today.
BBC journalists conducted an undercover investigation revealing how drug manufacturers and sellers are illegally selling drugs to children in Nigeria.
Codeine is not a toy: Emzor has not harmed anyone.
Emzor Pharmaceuticals has suspended one of its staff for the BBC report titled "Codeine Kills."
A boy is taking cough syrup, codeine.
The news says that politicians are giving young people drugs as gifts.
The pharmaceutical company in Nigeria, Emzor Pharmaceuticals, has fired one employee and suspended two others due to their involvement in the illegal sale of codeine cough syrup, according to a BBC investigation that revealed how the cough syrup has contributed to the deaths of Nigerian youths.
Emzor has informed their marketing team about the BBC reporter who covered the Emzolyn syrup.
They said this on social media after BBC released the footage they made on Monday evening, April 30.
In the footage that lasted about an hour, a group of drug sellers included a worker from Emzor who was seen administering medicines to the people.
Anger and disappointment filled those who came to see the movie that was shown in Lagos yesterday.
Someone said that politicians are the ones pouring fuel into the fire burning in Kano as he stated that they are using the homeless as a gift.
But Emzor Pharmaceuticals has stated that they do not sell drugs inappropriately.
They also said that they have stopped selling Emzolyn with Codeine until they finish the investigation into the charges of illegally selling their cough syrup.
Emzor stopped bringing their one bid and eventually withdrew it from consideration.
Emzor Pharmaceuticals is a reputable company that operates independently.
They have a license to sell drugs exceeding two hundred, which includes Emzolyn Codeine approved by NAFDAC.
They went on to say: "The distribution of Emzolyn Codeine should be halted until a complete investigation is conducted."
In a BBC interview with the head of the department responsible for the training and work of pharmacists in Nigeria's southeastern region, J.C. Okafor stated that there are regulations in place regarding the distribution of cough syrups containing codeine, and if any pharmacy is found distributing it improperly, it will be shut down.
Okafor said, "We have a plan on how to distribute cough medicine with codeine in Nigeria, which makes it so that a person cannot buy it without a doctor's prescription."
"Any office that violates that law, we close it."
Some Nigerians on social media are criticizing Emzor for their role in the severe drug abuse problem among young people.
One person questioned the organization, saying: "So, if the BBC does not showcase that investigation, will your organization do anything to stop the excessive use of this drug among the youth?"
Don't the workers know what they are doing?
Another person, Mairo Mandara, called for the government to ban the sale of cough medicine containing codeine.

Bioraj Pharmaceuticals has announced that they have terminated their employee, Junaid Hassan, for misconduct, while Emzor also stated that they have dismissed their employee, Chukwunonye Madubuike, for misconduct.
Both appeared in the BBC picture as people using their backs to sell codeine drugs.
But those who are speaking say that the government should punish these agencies more than the investigation being conducted on them.
